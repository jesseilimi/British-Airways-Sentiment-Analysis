 trip verified    flight mainly let down by a disagreeable flight attendant no queue to check in at cape town  good however checkin agent was unfamiliar with ba size and weight rules for sports bags so had to wait  minutes while phone calls were made  annoying lounge was good gate service was excellent with organised queues seat was good the new upgraded club suite the zip broke off the amenity kit so it was unusable  ba cutting corners too much here offered a cocktail service which came promptly and the drink was excellent but no nuts so i went off to the galley to ask for some nuts or a snack to go with it i spoke to a male flight attendant who looked at me with utter distaste that i had the temerity to ask for nuts the he said where have you come from what a bizarre question i said seat e to which he responded with a flick of his hand  go ask her shes serving you i was stunned  i have not been treated that way in even the cheapest restaurants let alone business class on a premium airline the gentlemen concerned has no place in service or hospitality and should find a different line of work anyway the food was good the ife worked fine wifi wasnt working i managed  hours sleep and we got off the plane promptly despite being at a remote stand requiring a bus the luggage took quite a while to arrive overall  would be  but for the rude staff member
 trip verified    another awful experience by british airways this flight was delayed nearly  hour british airways charges an extortionate amount for their tickets but the service is bad for me
 trip verified    the service was rude full of attitude to me the food is poorly serviced the cabin during the flight was never cleaned in particularly the toilets
 trip verified    this flight was a joke there was four people in business class including myself and my companion the service was outrageous the crew was too busy flirting with the captain and where she was going for the day off instead of paying attention in the cabin 
 trip verified    this time british airways managed to get everything right the price of the tickets was reasonable and the timing was perfect boarding was smooth and the seats were comfortable  easy reline to enable dozing and sufficient pitch to get in and out the table was firm enough to allow the use of a small laptop and mouse a preflight soft drink or prosecco was offered and both the food and drink were more than sufficient the best part was the cabin crew  two in pe and they were both extremely efficient pleasant and witty there was a good selection of movies and both the screen and the headset worked perfectly
 trip verified    the seats were excellent with a feel of much more room than the official seat pitch i am ft in we could sleep for a couple of hours daytime flight with the blinds down as they should be no point booking a window seat in my view i focus on seat quality much more than smiley faces and food the food was middling and the second meal before landing was distinctly subpar
 trip verified    after the nightmare of getting through triple security at nairobi airport i was looking forward to a glass of something lovely to unwind on the plane fat chance an hour and a half after takeoff we were finally served a drink and meal together i keep reading how well ba are now doing but on both legs of this trip the crew were awful the club suites are a great improvement but if the staff make no effort whats the point on a positive note we were told my wifes seat was broken and could not recline i was going to swop but at the gate they found her another prior to this we received an email within  minutes of check in with a healthy portion of avios already added to our account well done customer service
 trip verified    prior to boarding a gate agent seemed to pick on elderly people and asked them to check in relatively small bags by contrast the same staff member looked the other way to a boisterous group of  somethings all of whom had large amounts of luggage london gatwick to marrakech with british airways was rather disappointing the flight is just over  hours and during this flight passengers in economy were offered a tiny packet of digestive biscuits no water was offered other than a cabin crew member walking through the aisle with a bottle of mineral water and plastic cups she claimed she ran out of water and so many passengers did not even get that miserly offering there was no route map on this a the captain made only  very brief announcements when i needed to use the lavatory one cabin crew member rudely drew the curtain as she was sitting behind the lavatories with one of her colleagues  they were loudly talking about their boyfriends and ignored an elderly man who was struggling to open the small door to the lavatory i shall add that the lavatory was unclean and had water on the floor one concern was the seemingly casual approach to the safety demonstration disembarkation was not well managed either this route is very competitive and these days one has a lot of choice i will not use british airways on this route
 trip verified    i flew from amsterdam to las vegas with a layover in heathrow in november  the day we were flying the weather wasnt great since i was on business i really needed to get to las vegas we anticipated on it and checked early if our flight was still leaving we would have had ample time to catch an earlier flight to heathrow or even take the train when we checked according to google our flight was delayed and we would miss our connection according to the staff of british airways the flight was not delayed and there was no reason for panic when we got to the airport there was still nothing wrong with our connection an hour before we were supposed to leave it was announced that the plane wasnt there yet and we would have a major delay we called customer service and they told us to just go to london and see from there we wanted some kind of assurance that we could be placed in a hotel since we would not be making our connecting flight and they refused to give those in the end we found a direct flight the next day and convinced british airways to book that for us even though they wanted to connect us through  additional layovers this resulted in approximately a  hour delay in our trip on our way back home they lost our luggage at the gate and took approximately  hours to find it at a wrong gate on the way back we tried to check in through the online portal my colleague was able to check in just fine but i couldnt i was afraid i was overbooked and contacted customer service  times  when i got to the airport i was overbooked and the ground staff had the nerve to tell me it was my fault for not checking in online since we were seated in premium economy i could be moved to regular economy but that does mean someone in economy was bumped off the plane when we got to london our flight back to amsterdam was delayed this was because there were disabled people on board of the plane still and there were not enough wheelchairs to get them off it took approximately  hours before boarding could begin  when we finally boarded we were told we needed a new pilot because the old pilot had now made too many hours waiting around to still fly us to amsterdam arriving in amsterdam they had left my luggage in las vegas so i needed to wait for another week before that was given back to me afterwards i have made a claim as soon as possible for my delays and hotel costs its been almost  months and they still havent replied every time i contact them they claim they have such a huge backlog that it takes long to process them 
 trip verified  first the good news the club suites are such a huge improvement over the old business seats i hope i never see one again the not so good news im afraid to say was the flight itself the food has really gone downhill since my last flight presumably this is a cost cutting measure if other airlines can offer a really decent quality meal why cant an airline of bas stature ive always thought that a good crew can make up for all the shortcomings but not this time the crew member looking after me could not have been more bored and was obviously just going through the motions they couldnt even be bothered to say cheerio and im not sure i would have answered if they did heres hoping my return is a more satisfying experience
 trip verified    i have never travelled with british airways before and this is the first time i chose to travel with ba due to the cheapest fare available during this time but i was bit unsure if i can enjoy my travel journey due to mixed reviews i would like to express my extreme joy and satisfaction travelling with this amazing airline i havent seen such a great efficient and friendly service by the cabin crew i would like to personally thanks ellie and adam who were not only very professional but very kind too food served was delicious and the drinks were good too i can say that i thoroughly enjoyed this flight and do not hesitate to recommend to anyone to try it
 trip verified  terrible overall medium service and the flight was delayed there was no help at all to reschedule a connecting flight the customer support was terrible and the request for compensation is still pending after one year
 trip verified    london heathrow to male in new business class ba continues to get its mojo back starting with a classy lounge serving innovative and interesting quality preflight food beetroot scotch eggs excellent wine whispering angel presentation of onboard food has always been a bit hit and miss with ba but on this occasion it was tasty and ok friendly and efficient on board crew smile treat them respectfully and as equals  on time flight and early arrival  only awarding a  because we were bussed from ac gates otherwise a really enjoyable experience
not verified   very good flight following an equally good flight to rome good food especially on an evening flight and aircraft early both ways just what short haul should be
not verified   an hours delay due to late arrival of the incoming aircraft the captain was a particularly able communicator who kept us in touch with the situation we got freebie upgrades to emergency exit seats from a friendly member of the crew in the end we were only  minutes behind schedule in a relatively comfortable elderly plane pretty stress free
 trip verified    i booked through ba because loganair dont have representatives in manchester airport loganair cancelled the flight but someone at ba marked the flight as delayed by  minutes ive spent over  days chasing bas complaints department who are at best totally ineffective they wont put you through to the people dealing with the claim apparently they dont have the facility to do so they wont phone loganair they wont look on manchester airports historic flight website to confirm the cancellation they wont put you through to a supervisor in fact they do very little but apologise for how little they do 
 trip verified    british airways lost bags in lhr then found them sent to cologne where it sat for two days before they told me but no one was there to give it to me i spent  days in europe without a bag bought clothes ba refused to reimburse me they closed the case  days after i returned to the states when my bag showed up at my front door they wont let you talk to management they say they email mail you but they dont then you call customer service they say they will escalate it but you will never know they dont update the claims or the forms 
 trip verified  the check in process and rewardloyalty program is a mess i am never able to get points even when trying it through a partner airline unfortunately for work i have to travel with them sometimes  this time the flight was delayed
 trip verified    we flew in november  but it took this long to seek a satisfactory response from ba which we ultimately never received ba refused to rebook my son and me at no cost that day due to lack of underground service  alternate service ba forced us to buy new tickets and never admitted that they subjected us to disparate treatment i will not be flying or recommending ba again
 trip verified  i left for london from johannesburg at  on  december  my only issue with that flight was the pillows they gave us were dirty and when my  year old dropped some juice and i asked a cabin crew member walking past for some serviettes she told me to go to the bathroom to get some to clean it up those issues werent pleasant but certainly not a major problem i was booked on the ba at  on  december  to return to johannesburg the flight was delayed to the  january  at pm i had a connecting flight to durban and do not live in johannesburg landing in johannesburg with  children at  am was not an option for me ba changed my flight to nd january  at  i requested a sooner date so i could get home sooner i was given  january  at  i accepted this as this is the original time i opted for and would he most convenient for me as i was doing a connection in johannesburg to durban unfortunately this flight was delayed till nd january at  i was extremely upset by this as i was absolutely exhausted and had  children who were absolutely exhausted i also suffer from eczema and hay fever and did not have my creams and medication this caused my eczema to flare up so badly even my lips were cracked and burning my allergies were so severe that my eyes were sticking together and i couldnt stop sneezing my daughter also has eczema and has had a flare up the staff had no sympathy or empathy for a mother traveling alone and her children i was just told that they know its an inconvenience and a lady even snapped at me that they trying their best my children are   and  and we were all booked on separate seats is that even legal let alone ethical they were refusing to help me and saying they cant do anything i approached  people and the third person finally put us together so they could clearly help me my flight from johannesburg to durban was originally booked on south african airways and i paid a lot for this ticket as south african airways is not a low cost airline i was given a cheap low cost airline cemair which i had never even heard of to replace my saa flight i suffer from flight anxiety and this is why i never book low cost airlines with tiny flights my anxiety went through the roof on the flight besides all of this i am also left with a huge credit card bill as i used up all my pounds on the st i know ba is obliged to compensate me for the inconvenience under eu law but besides the compensation ba staff really needs to show more empathy for their passengers like me who had two hours long flight delays two days in a row and was alone with  children i expect my full compensation for all of us as this has been by far the worst experience i have had traveling all their staff kept saying is thats why you will get compensation i am now waiting to see if i get compensated as i was promised by all of their ground staff legally they have to under eu law so lets see if they put up a fight or do what is ethical and legal
 trip verified    after an excellent flight on a  cpt to lhr the return was not as good ba have moved the business class checkin from one end of the hall to the other at t for no apparent reason so a nice long walk to check in fast track security was very slow  minutes the indicator board suggested the south lounge was half full but when i went it was uncomfortably full and it is still tatty as not refurbished so i went to the b pier lounge instead much better except as usual the staff are sort of trying to pack up early and have a bizarre way of refilling the food containers which involves actually removing them to the kitchen which means they are gone a lot of the time rather than replenishing them customer side very employeecentric behaviour time for the flight so down to the transit to take us to the c gates except the transit had decided not to stop any more at the b gates so we watched five maybe seven transits pass through without stopping eventually me and a group of maybe  other passengers of mixed ages decided to descend to the walkway and run all the way to the c gates we all arrived soaked in sweat  not a nice start to a long business class flight the a is spacious but the seat is outdated now and in urgent need of replacement ife was not working and had to be rebooted the headphone prong was bent so headphones not working the usb port was not working drinks were brought out promptly starter salmon was delicious  truly excellent beef was tough  i think a bad piece of meat rather than badly cooked wines were good cheese was average to good staff were friendly good nights sleep breakfast good the recheck experience at jnb is a huge hassle  there is a giant screen saying domestic recheck and a queue but when you get to the front of the queue you are told it is safair only and not for saa bas local partner what a hassle why arent we warned or told this  loads of ba passengers making the same mistake overall  its the little things that would make this better fast track actually fast track refurbish the south lounge have food replenishment in the passenger area not the kitchen make sure the transits stop even late in the evening refurbish the as ask do  co who are generally excellent by the way to monitor meat quality rigorously
 trip verified    on a recent flight from cyprus ba on  the second the cabin door was closed the pilot announced we would be held on the runway for  hours they know this prior and did not inform passengers until after we had boarded the flight home took nearly  hours due to weather conditions this plus  hours waiting what did ba offer during this  hour hell flight  oatmeal biscuits and ml of water for our family when i went to the cabin crew to ask for more water which i was told there wasnt any  out of the  cabin crew were asleep in the back row seats of the aircraft ba on  this infuriated me further as i had previously asked if there were any spare seats so that my  year old could spread out and get some sleep if available i was told the flight was full after we arrived late my connecting flight had now been missed we then queued at the connections desk in a large queue only to watch the ba staff clock off for the night in front of us no genuine support was given to me or my family and we were effectively abandoned by ba ive tried to speak to someone but their helpline has an automated message saying due to the number of calls not surprised by that aspect they cant assist me then hang up tried this several times at various times i think its their default message have raised this via their email system unsurprisingly been mugged off and cant escalate until  weeks have passed like i said a national disgrace 
 trip verified    flight ba  arrived in rome on  december where all passengers received a sms from ba to say that their luggage had been left in london  my wife and i completed the required form but were in a queue for  hours to have it checked ba s agent in rome believe the baggage would arrive on the last flight that night pm and would most likely be delivered next day nobody from ba in rome airport made contact with us to explain what happened and when bags would arrive we finally got our luggage delivered to us at pm on sunday  december  the day before we were due to leave rome during the waiting period there was no contact initiated by either ba or their rome agents and on several occasions when we called both rome and london help desks we received no updates in  years of travelling together this has never happened before and the sheer neglect in keeping us informed is disgusting sadly for ba we will never fly with it again and will share our horror story with others and strongly encourage them to fly with another airline i would give ba an overall rating of zero
 trip verified    this was the first time i flew british airways and it was a huge disappointment while the seat is quite good the food is very simple and the service is subpar but not only that heathrow airport their hub is by far the worst large airport ive seen in europe when we landed in dc i had an email saying that my luggage stayed in london this was last wednesday i have an airtag so i could follow my suitcase it came to washington the following day thursday ever since its been sitting in the airport british offers no means of communication the online chat is a bot the bot tells me to call a number in england i did its another bot when you say you have in inquiry about luggage it sends you a link via sms and hangs up no option to talk to a human in the claim form they gave me theres a local phone which reaches a voicemail i keep calling them  times today only and leaving messages saying that the airtag shows the suitcase in iad and offering to go pick it up so they dont need to deliver it no one replies to the voicemail so basically i am shut out with no luggage no information no customer service and no one to talk to 
 trip verified    pretty good flight but still some small things that can be improved check in was quick lounge was good  tasty food and well chosen wines disappointingly they had not secured a gate so we had to bus to the aircraft and it was all a hot scrum i got the last bus to avoid the crush emirates turkish lufthansa qatar all had planes on gates  why not ba pennypinching then it turned out the cabin crew forgot about those on the last bus so i had to ask for a welcome drink it came and the champagne was actually cold well done ba  first time they managed to serve champagne cold in my  years of flying with them big improvement cabin and seat were lovely as always i greatly prefer to the emirates whitegold bling drinks service was prompt ife was good starter trout was ok main chicken was excellent cheese was sold not cold as it should be wines were excellent we were not disturbed through the night so got a good sleep on a comfy bed cabin was a bit too warm though for my personal preference was woken up as asked and served a tasty breakfast small detail  as it is impossible to get water to c at altitude maybe ba could warm the ceramic coffee cups so coffee retains its heat a bit longer pouring not quite hot coffee into a nice but cold china mug means it is lukewarm instantly off the plane in record time  minutes after parking bags were waiting for us on the belt excellent work by the ground staff overall  improvement points gate not bus to the plane dont forget passengers on the last bus or who board late but well before pushback standout cabin crew member was miguel  what a star
 trip verified  check in was fine but no priorityfast track lines for security or boarding there is only one lounge option for first class customers in mexico city which is the american airlines admirals club which is abysmal there is a free bar serving cheap alcohol  an awful food selection  and nowhere to shower on board  i find the seat really comfortable the crew were fantastic and im starting to really see some consistency in the quality of their first class crew the drink selection was fine the food was appalling we were the victims of their new supper service this is basically a dinner service with a lot less optionschoice no fishseafood options on either the starters or the mains first choice of main unavailable as only two had been loaded the fillet steak so drying and overcooked that i heard at least three people send it back pretty impressive for a cabin of just eight passengersdreadful dessert and cheeseboard luggage off swiftly the other end  so good to see priority tagging working
 trip verified  british airways is absolute rubbish i had to fly to amsterdam for an urgent appointment the flight was cancelled last minute presumably due to bad weather theyve kept us at the gate saying the plane couldnt land while literally every plane from that airport was taking off and landing with zero issues there was another klm flight to amsterdam scheduled to depart at the same time it took off on time and another klm flight to amsterdam later the evening also took off without any problems its just the one operated by british airways was cancelled because of the bad weather apparently the weather was so bad that every plane could land and take off successfully apart from theirs i had to rebook myself on the eurostar the next day and would still miss the important appointment that i intended to go to amsterdam for all thanks to british airways
 trip verified  the flight time was changed at the last minute without warning and no assistance was provided by the ground staff rd party agents regarding the impact for the delay nor was any help forthcoming from the phoneline nobody in the airline wants to take responsibility for anything this is fundamentally an unreliable airline onboard service was poor and not even as good as some low cost airlines
 trip verified    im so fraustrated my flight was cancelled last minute which wasnt the end of the world even though the earliest i could get rebooked was three days later its the insane saga of events that proceeded to claim the compensation that im legally entitled to according to eu rules used their claims page and all was ok it was from there that it became incomprehensibly frustrating my case was closed but no confirmation of what the conclusion was or any money i tried calling but kept being lead in circles customer services cant speak to the claims team the claims team cant be spoken to directly customer service dont have access to the claims teams system and so on  calls later and nothing could be done i had to throw my toys out of the pram on the last call and someone finally updated me i thought that was the end they had confirmed the claim and that i would be transferred what i was due and then they got the amount wrong i wrote to they to highlight this and they said that they would rectify it almost  month since the original flight was cancelled and still havent received what is owed to me as compensation for my wife and son i have sent two more emails in the last two days and ive yet to get a response it is criminal that they are not adhering to the aviation rules that dictate compensation for cancelled flights terrible customer service and honestly cant belive that ba are capable of such awful service
 trip verified  we have sat on this plane for an hour and forty five minutes awaiting takeoff due to bad weather in london this is understandable for safety fortunately i have a long layover so this delay does not affect me however many others are not so lucky while waiting we were given one small bottle of water and one tiny pack of corn kernels later food and drink were offered for purchase this is my complaint after sitting idle on this plane for nearly two hours and possibly missing connecting flights they cant give us a free bag of chips and a coke when i asked i was told no is british airways really this cheap and money grubbing
not verified   british airways stranding my wife and i at heathrow airport for  days with no access to our baggage we we told by airline employees to purchase any necessities toiletries refreshments etc and wed be reimbursed that claim was denied with ba claiming that weather was the reason for the delay an outright lie since every other airline in london was flying ontime we were unable to to anything besides stand in lines for vouchers stand in lines for shuttles stand in line for reservations etc for  hours it was an absolute nightmare and i will never fly ba again
 trip verified    although like many these days i avoid ba on long haul from london heathrow due to my perception of poor service and lack of customer services if things go wrong i was pleasantly surprised by my recent flight to belfast the aircraft actually left on time and arrived ahead of schedule the cabin crew looked bored and uninspired as they can often do on ba i read at times but that didnt really matter it was a quiet flight so i say myself at the emergency exit unchallenged which was handy would fly again with ba where pressed
 trip verified  this flight was british airways at its very best the flight attendants were outstanding  processional attentive and helpful the food was very good and the seatlie flat bed was very comfortable i love to smart design of the a club world cabin wonderful flight home
not verified  the worst airline i have ever flown with they cancelled my flight  hours before departure and didnt even contact me they didnt put me on a new flight  i had to rebook myself for the next day  and i was also left to find my own accommodation which was a nightmare and have been refused compensation and i was left stranded onboard services are also archaic and outdated and the planes are the oldest out of any airline ive flown with food and service was the worst ive ever experienced and ive travelled on most airlines emirates etihad thai malaysian qantas cathay ua etc do not fly with ba
 trip verified    disappointing service plane interior and terribly incompetent customer service i booked my flight directly through bas website soon after i started to get emails saying my selected seats i paid extra for the selection had been changed by ba without any reason given and i was directed to the website there i found no information on the said seat change this happened several times i had  flights altogether the website seems to be a digital dinosaur the first leg of my flight was fine until i discovered in the transfer area at heathrow that i forgot my new laptop onboard immediately i contacted bas so called customer service what an oxymoron which basically said they can not do anything i would have to wait until the cleaners working for a contractor would have finished their job and hope they would discover the laptop and return it to so called lost  found at the airport bas customer service said they couldnt contact their colleagues in the terminalgate were the plane was still and let them know there was a lost laptop by seat no a of the plane yes i told them exactly were the laptop was they wouldnt take any contact details either to notify me if and when the laptop would be returned and they refused to register the incident they simply had no interest in assisting me and didnt even make an attempt to pretend they did communication via their online customer service was poor and they didnt even respond to my messages in the end i emailed the representative at heathrow and he replied with a message form his supervisor which did not reveal his name it is not the duty of british airways to find lost property on behalf of our passengers however if you would like to dispute this you can contact customer relations online with further feedback they took no responsibility and referred me to smartecarte which is the contractor cleaning their planes and apparently collecting lost items at heathrow i have not received the laptop worth  thousand gbp back now  weeks later the flights between london and cape town  hours were unpleasant the flight attendants were seemingly unenthusiastic about their job it took up to an hour to collect the trash after the meal which also was distributed extremely slowly food was not good boarding was slow and inefficient drinks were only offered twice otherwise youd have to ask for it especially on this long flights the seats were of fabric uncomfortable and room too scarce to relax and sleep all in all flying with british airways was disappointing and i will not be keen on flying with them again 
 trip verified    a transit visa is required for my partner to transit via london to iceland so i had to buy a separate ticket for her via another airline when we reach iceland i emailed british airways telling then she wont be using her return ticket and requested for a partial refund  days later i received an email from customer service that i need to contact one of their service centres via the provided link i replied to say the link only goes to a page with various british landline phone numbers to call and explained that i am overseas then and it will not be practical to do this via international calls they replied to say i can only do this by contacting the service centres so the airline end up taking my money regardless 
 trip verified    i was surprised to receive confirmation preflight that i had  kgs luggage allowance this to be later confirmed as one at  kg checked in another  kgs carry on for under seat and a third  kgs carry on for overhead stowage checkin opened a bit late and the line for executive club members even later but was courteous and efficient long queue for passport control but the fault of brexit not ba my seat had no screen no earphone socket no charge point no seat recline no boarding music all the same as low cost carriers captain announced wonderful service from emily and crew  maybe it was in club class not the economy cabin it was announced that they would serve complimentary water and snack but only the snack came it was also announced there would be free text messaging for exec club members but i couldnt get it to work although a member snacks were sold some at twice tui price for example cadburys chocolate fingers at  i chose ba this time as when i booked it was cheaper than all the charter carriers and being british i mustnt forget bas impeccable safety record and normally reliable service after landing the purser thanked the crew for their hard work seems pushing one small cart down the aisle during four hours constitutes hard work in ba but at least we were on time
 trip verified    flight cancelled not refunding our money saying we took the flight that never happened not refunding the new flights we booked hotels food while we were stranded did not provide food or water while waiting for hours on tarmac will not provide information as to why they arent refunding the flight that never happened saying there is no more information
 trip verified    i had visa issues and hence was debarred from flying the ground staff at mumbai was excellent a woman named brinelle was very helpful and understanding i had to rebook my tickets and while the original journey was consisting of  legs ba forced me to rebook the entire ticket because their system did not allow them to rebook just that one leg even though there was a gap of  days between the two legs not like they were connecting flights the telephone operator was rude took  minutes and kept saying she needed  more minutes to give me clarity it was horrendous the final price they offered me for rebooking  of the  legs was much more than the original fare for all  legs she was torturous ba was horrendous because the website does not allow you to do all this a very poor experience in all
 trip verified    singapore to heathrow with ba two choices on this route a or  in economy and premium and first there isnt much in it in club world the  wins as it has the suite check in was easy security and passport control in singapore is efficient choice of  lounges ba qantas or qatar the latter wins easily ba lounge was ok no major negatives qantas wins on space boarding was on time the aircraft has a high density club world cabin service was fine club suite was good its the food and beverages that are being targeted i feel the st meal starter was good main of beef fillet was average same sentiment for cheese wines were acceptable champagne choice is cheap so i did not try service for meals efficient given the full cabin breakfast was similar the menu suggested that some might want to skip a main course and opt for starter and dessert for this to work for ba a major shift in how lounge options are sourced and presented would be needed as it was i slept well we arrived early luggage off quickly for once so a reasonable flight overall my warning to ba is that food and beverages in club world are drifting in the wrong direction
 trip verified    i recently travelled from munich to london with british airways and it turned into an absolute nightmare our troubles began with their malfunctioning app despite checking in successfully i was unable to retrieve our boarding passes upon arrival at the airport we discovered that there were no selfservice kiosks and the checkin desks were completely unattended after seeking help from the information desk we were directed to a staff member who clearly did not want to assist us her dismissive attitude was infuriating and despite showing her the app indicating we were checked in she simply told us to call customer service and walked away without providing any assistance after being put on hold for  minutes and being sent to several different staff members who couldnt help us we finally reached someone on the phone who was kind but ultimately powerless to resolve our issue by this point our flight was delayed and we had wasted two hours just trying to print our boarding passes when i followed up with a complaint british airways basically dismissed my concerns and told me to use the app next timeignoring the fact that it was the apps failure that caused all these problems in the first place this experience cost us a staggering  in additional expenses including new flights hotel stays taxi fares and fines missing work and explaining this absurd situation to my employer was incredibly embarrassing british airways clearly needs to improve its customer service and technology if their app and website are going to fail they must provide adequate support at the airport i will never fly with them again and i urge others to consider alternative airlines
not verified   i paid for seats  a and b on my flight from heathrow to boston on the a paying for premium economy seats upon arrival at the airport the ticket agent said i was not healthy enough to sit in the purchased seats due to being too old i presume  since there is no other reason i can find i could not sit in the exit seating i am healthy enough to walk  miles a day and have adequate upper body strength attempting to convince her just got us stuck in a cattle call seat at the rear of the aircraft second floor and in the middle two seats of the row we were told our money would be refunded immediately for the inconvenience after several weeks i recontacted ba and they said the complaint went to the wrong section and they were forwarding it to the next section  weeks later and we still have not heard any updates except for a computer response stating most refunds were returned in  weeks keep waiting the plane then had ground difficulties and needed a quick repair they completed that  minutes later and boarded the flight the captain then came on and said it looks like they forgot to order the ground crew to back us out of the terminal and we needed to wait another  minutes we were not able to make up for the lost time in the air we landed  hours later than scheduled wreaking havoc with our next flight
not verified  the flight wasnt that bad although the inflight entertainment wasnt great the screen was very oldfashioned it was hard to operate in the dark as the touch screen wasnt working at times there was though a remote the cabin crew slamming air larders ovens and draws apart from that the cabin crew were nice the food was good and the seat was comfortable
 trip verified   i decided to treat myself and my teenage daughter to world traveller plus on the return leg of our canada holiday paying hundreds of pounds extra to do so only to end up spending nine and a half hours trapped in a broken seat staring at a blank screen after both our entertainment systems failed to work i hadnt bought a book or uploaded a film because i had assumed i would be enjoying the entertainment ba had promised so i decided to lie back and get some rest instead only to discover that the leg rest on my seat didnt work the flight attendant was able to prop it up manually by shoving things underneath but unfortunately this only made matters worse because it became firmly stuck in the up position forcing my body into an awkward position during the descent when i had to keep my seatback upright leaving me with back pain that lasted three days i have a bad lower back early on in this experience i asked to be moved to economy so that i could sit normally and watch a film but the flight was full and there was no space the apologetic flight attendant assured me i would receive compensation which i assumed meant the airline would at the very least upgrade us the next time we flew ba since we had been unable to enjoy any of the advertised benefits of world traveller plus the two of us only had one suitcase each so hadnt made use of the extra baggage allowance bas actual compensation offer  worth of avios points each i wrote back since ba doesnt allow you to have any direct telephone contact with their complaints department explaining firmly but politely that this was not fair or acceptable given the hundreds of extra pounds id paid for added extras the airline had failed to deliver they then ghosted me my experience is a cautionary tale about british airways customer support if all goes to plan you may well have a very pleasant world traveller plus experience but if anything should go wrong support staff will wash their hands of you and your money will have been wasted so unless youre prepared to gamble i would advise you to either stick with economyworld traveller since then youre only really paying to fly from a to b which they do manage to do or fly with another airline or you could end up like me throwing away extra money on an experience that fell far below the standard of economy class if your flight is to canada i would recommend an airline such as air canada which i turned to during the uncertainty of the covid pandemic because of their exceptional customer service and fast nononsense refunds they do cost a bit more so when life returned to normal postcovid i started flying ba again believing such high standards of customer service were no longer important i now see that this was both a mistake and a false economy  one that has ended up costing me hundreds of wasted pounds
not verified   i was very impressed with their efficient boarding the relatively compared to air canada comfortable seats and the quality of the food drinks and snacks frequently offered overall a no fuss no bother experience
not verified   the flight scheduled at  left hours  minutes alter due to late arrival of incoming aircraft from naples as a result i missed a connection from istanbul to dubai nothing unusual the issue acknowledged by the captain is that the plane had been late since the morning flight from rome with rolling effect until the evening as this was the case whey did ba not contact me and all other passengers i could have made other arrangements and fly early to istanbul and not miss my connection resulting in a  charge and a long delay ba has certainly lots of staff who could have informed by using the email or text obviously passengers are of no utility to ba once the ticket is purchased who can trust ba to travel not me now after such poor handling of a simple matter
 trip verified    i have been flying ba for over  years i was an american airlines ff and gave it up for ba i am a gold member on ba and have been for over  years here are the things i have noticed over the last  years on ba the flight attendants are getting lazier and complacent from cleaning bathrooms to serving meals the food on ba has deteriorated to the point of not being able to eat the garbage they give you and having gold status is almost meaningless in the big scheme of things i have never been able to upgrade to business or first using the avios points i have accumulated on a transcon flight i fly ba now because its the only partner of american airllines that i can easily get to europe i have switched back to aa ff program and is already so much better ba used to be a splendid airline and now its just another poor airline in the european market
 trip verified    on arriving at mexico airport we were told that the flight was delayed because the aircraft had broken down and the replacement aircraft from lhr was about six hours late when we eventually managed to check in we told that  contrary to the ba website  we could not have access to the hour grand lounge elite and instead would use the american airlines admirals club lounge which would close three hours before the flight left after that we would have to use a restaurant and were given a food voucher two hours before the flight was due to leave were then informed that the aircraft had diverted to cancun because of a volcanic ash cloud over mexico city  although it did not appear to be affecting other flights into the airport including those from europe they eventually arranged taxis to take us to a hotel and we arrived at am we were assured that we would all be on a ba flight leaving the same time the following day the only contact after that was a local employee who stayed at the hotel he said that he was there to organise transport and refused to give us any other contact details when we eventually did need transport the following day he had disappeared during the night we were then sent an email telling us that we were booked onto an air canada flight leaving at am this would have been impossible with such short notice and without canadian epa authorisation we then spent two hours trying to make contact with ba  its mexico number did not work and eventually we were put on an aeromexico flight in economy they told us to check in as soon as we could but this meant we had to pay an extra  for the seats later after a very long call we were told that we could be upgraded to business with aeromexico despite having been told earlier that there was no availability ba then informed us that because we had already checked in  as they had suggested  we could not be moved and this took three more calls to aeromexico to sort out i totally understand that aircraft break down but the onus should be on the airline to rearrange and not the passengers we were lucky because we took the trouble of making the calls to the uk but others  such as a disabled lady  had been told nothing when we left
 trip verified    i have flown british airways for many years and still do so regularly in one of my last flights this past summer between paris and boston british booked me on a connecting flight between paris and london that gave me a maximum of  minutes to connect in london london heathrow is a massive airport where going from terminal to terminal could take  minutes once you deplane not including the actual time to deplane if you are seated in the back and lines at passport control and security between terminals so already one is pressed for time my flight from paris to london that day was tardy  minutes tardy that day to be exact ba flight  in fact is routinely tardy  dont bother with this one flight connections assisted me by calling the new gate to let them know my previous flight had been delayed and that i was rushing to the gate it was  minutes before my connecting flight was to depart i ran like a fool for  minutes carryons and all arriving to the gate  minutes before my flight was to depart only to be greeted by no plane the agent said that since no one knew where i was false the plane left without me  early gaining a few minutes was more important than an passenger inconvenienced by their own delay so i made the  minute trek back to flight connections knowing that they would have to rebook me the following day i was now going to miss the wedding i was destined to attend in boston they sent me to a prepaid hilton hotel room for the night but told me that i would have to pay  pounds each way for a taxi to take me there they gave me a pamphlet with instructions for reimbursement this was in early july it took me  months and a complaint to the british centre for effective dispute resolution to be reimbursed for the equivalent of  there was no apology no recognition not even a free drink coupon for that next flight i wont ever take with british like a bad insurance claim british just kept denying my claim expecting that i would just go away well i am going away im taking my  and using another airline for future travel
not verified  we bought tickets for a genevalondon flight but when we got to the airport we were told that the airline had oversold tickets on our flight and that passengers on an earlier cancelled flight had been given seats on our flight explanation it is allowed 
 trip verified    appalling service with failing defective fleet of a aircraft flown four times on this route or return and significant delays of  to  hours every time ba boarded pm on  october flight cancelled for technical reasons six hours to return through customs and recover bag no ba management at all at johannesburg that night further four hours to organise a hotel and transfer with queues of  people to check in room eventually accessed am no attempt to reschedule or assist  pilot trying to announce process
 trip verified  british airways charge you for the pleasure of choosing your seat and i had been put at the very back of club which turned out to be an advantage because it meant i could get to the seat without having to climb over anybody the seat was clean but as i later discovered that the foldout section would not stay up and your feet dangled over the edge when the bed was extended after boarding was complete we were told that departure was delayed because ba had not loaded all of the cargo we were then told that it was delayed further because there was a fault with one of the fuel pumps it took over five hours for this problem to be corrected as the pilot later informed us that they installed new pump having initially thought that it was a software issue during that time we were served the meal but were told that alcohol is not permitted which was curious given that we had already been served a predeparture drink most of the cabin crew were male and apparently based in mexico and this turned out to be a pleasant surprise given that those i spoke to were incredibly positive and friendly but seemed embarrassed at what was happening i knew that it was the oldstyle seats but what was less acceptable is bas petty penny pinching if there was a competition for the smallest hot towel ba would be the winner the food sounded nice and looked impressive but seemed totally tasteless
 trip verified  what is wrong with you guys people pay lots of money for a business class ticket but you sit squeezed into a seat with no legroom nothing is clean the overhead lockers are empty and they want you to put your bag under the seat so that you have no room for your legs anymore and then serve you food that is just rubbish the staff demonstrates its british arrogance with no manners there is no decent polite service anymore there is really no difference to easyjet at all its the same on their european routes
 trip verified    we booked two business class seat with british airways in july  for the flight on september   we were told on september  at the heathrow airport that our flight was cancelled and we could only have one business seat with another flight to a different airport no one from the british airways contacted us to apologize and to offer refund for the business class seat we lost we filed a complaint to the british airways and asked for reimbursement on september  and have not heard a word from them as of october   it is the worst flight experience we have ever had terrible customer service zero communication with customers we cannot even find a phone number to call the british airways on its website
 trip verified  ive flown with many airlines but my recent experience with british airways left much to be desired the inflight entertainment was underwhelming and i was disappointed by the lack of basic amenities such as a comfort kit with essentials like eye masks while the only positive aspect was the slightly more generous legroom overall i found the service to be far below expectations not impressed
 trip verified    i recently flew from new york back to london with ba this wasnt my first long haul with them however it was my first time travelling in world traveler plus we boarded the aircraft on time and stress free and my first impression was good the cabin was clean and the leg room was good the recline on the seat was generous and combined with a footrest it was quite comfortable waiting on our seats was a decent quality cushion and blanket as well as an amenity kit the amenity kit contained some good headphones socks an eye mask lip balm pen and toothbrush and toothpaste once boarding was complete we were offered a pre departure drink with orange juice water or champagne being the options the crew were all very friendly and professional and did their upmost to ensure that everyone was happy once in the air we were offered a hot towel and another round of drinks this time with a lot more selection drinks were offered several times throughout the flight a menu was also handed out not long after take off the starter was quinoa and for main there was a choice of chicken meatballs and pasta or a vegetarian mushroom dish i chose the meatballs and they were really good my only real complaint about the flight was people not getting the dish they wished for we were sat in the last row of the premium economy cabin and by the time the meal service got to us all of the chicken dishes were gone the moral of the story is that if you sit at the front of the cabin you will likely get your preferred meal option after the meal i chose to watch some shows on the well sized entertainment screen ba is definitely up there for best inflight entertainment finally about an hour before landing we were served a breakfast snack this come in the form of a warm egg and swiss cheese bagel it was edible but also a little soggy and didnt really taste of much i certainly wont be craving one anytime soon we touched down into heathrow on time before disembarking the aircraft and picking up our bags everything was very efficient and we were on our way in no time
not verified    ba business class in europe has a seat the same as economy you simply have an empty seat next to you and so for many the only true benefits are in flight meals lounge access and priority security etc the problem on this flight was a small child aged around five who sang incessantly in an extremely loud voice throughout most of the flight i am aware of the difficulties of flying with children i know it is difficult to keep them entertained etc i am a patient person i have headphones the parents of this child chose despite a polite request not to try and quieten their child at all at this point one had an expectation the crew will step in if i was singling loudly disrupting other passengers they would quite rightly ask me to desist so why not speak to the parents of a child who is doing the same and disrupting the rest and sleep of other passengers instead having served the meal the crew retreated behind their curtain and left the passengers to stew simply not good enough as for wifi forget it
 trip verified  our flight started in seattle wa heading to lisbon portugal after a  hour flight and a  hour layover we boarded flight ba to lisbon after heading to the runway the plane stopped and the pilot said we have a small mechanical issue and a mechanic is in route after an hour in the tarmac the flight crews announce they were going to offer complimentary water really another half hour goes by and they say the flight is cancelled no reason at that time as we wait for a bus to remove all passengers from the plane they announce that there will be staff members back at the gate to help with meal vouchers taxi rides and hotel accommodations what we get off the bus and there is a line of passengers trying to figure out whats happening staff hands my wife and i a  meal voucher and says go upstairs and someone will help you with your issues we go upstairs and nobody knows what to do one staff member hands us a paper for a hotel room and tells us to get your luggage and keep your receipt for the taxi to be reimbursed nothing else i asked about another flight and she said they will contact you asap who will contact and she walked away we grabbed our luggage and headed to the taxi line as we are being driven to the hotel i receive an email for our flight the next day on a different airline iberian our assigned seats are not together we get to the hotel and i barely fit into the shower and a double bed im  lbs and with my wife crazy get a little sleep nothing to eat until the am another taxi ride to the airport and tried to use our meal vouchers but they were only good for the prior day went to the first customer service line and he didnt have the authorization to issue new vouchers finally after the third customer service line we had someone issue us new vouchers finally made it to our destination a day in half later and still had to pay for our room that we didnt even use because of the cancellation ba refuses to reimburse us for that first night we missed filed a claim with ba and nothing so far we will never fly ba again

 trip verified    british airways world traveller plus premium economy product needs some improvement to justify the high cost over economy yes the seat and leg room are far superior and on this flight the crew were excellent however lunchdinner was only average wine selection was poor and like some other airlines ba provides a revolting snack prior to landing the same snack is served in economy choice of entertainment also requires improvement if ceo sean doyle is serious about elevating ba to one one of the worlds best airlines which it once was then work is needed to provide a better customer experience
 trip verified    ba is barely a step above low cost airlines they try to dime and nickel everywhere possible i now found out that you cannot select a seat a check in anymore when you have no baggage next time i go with low cost carrier since there is virtually no difference anymore
not verified   happy with the flight crew hadnt been on a plane in  years and was stressed out they made it comfortable for me and i want to say thank you to the flight crew for helping me relax if i go back to france again im going british airways
 trip verified    horrible service from boarding to landing i flew from london to marrakech and was very disappointed with the arrangement for boarding my food is horrible the staff are arrogant to me and the seats are super uncomfortable for a hmin flight business class today taking the flight from marrakech to london i do not recommend 
not verified   my wife and i are very disappointed with flying on british airways our flight on  was cancelled while all other airlines were flying in addition our seats changed multiple times without any explanation the people working were very rude and not at all customer oriented
not verified   we flew ba between heathrow and berlin one way connection our experience with ba ground staff at heathrow was very good friendly and helpful at check in and baggage drop off the crew on our flight were also very good captain provided some general information and welcoming in a suitable casual but efficient way flight stewards were also very friendly and handed out some water and small snack chocolate bar unexpected on a  hr  min flight seating was typical for class of aircraft and ticket cleanliness was not optimal and could be improved from memory a slightly delayed departure from heathrow which was slightly reduced on arrival at berlin this was not an issue for us as berlin was our destination with no connecting concerns our baggage arrived safely at berlin i understand ba has had some very negative reviews by customers but our experience on this occasion was very positive and would happily recommend and use ba
not verified   absolutely disgusted with ba our flights were cancelled on  may by ba even though the flight still departed we had a connecting flight from manchester to heathrow which was cancelled due to weather so could not get compensation for that flight but now it turns out we cannot get compensation for our flight to seattle either even though ba actually cancelled it for us i will never fly with them again
not verified  took a trip to nashville with my wife for a leisure break arrived at t and directed to the club world check in zone to the left of the terminal zone seemed way too small for the number of passengers and the check in process was painfully slow queues for non premium cabins seemed to be much more effectively managed had a bite to eat at the departures lounge plenty of food options even though it was very busy flight departed from the furthest away satellite gate in c annex boarding was managed efficiently i was in seat a in the club suites section lots of space and comfortable crew were   on average and very friendly and attentive i chose a salmon dish and was glad i was in a as they had run out by row  entertainment was a little disappointing in terms of latest release movies meal prior to landing was not to my taste so i skipped it flight landed right on schedule so no complaints on that basis
not verified   a nightmare journey courtesy of british airways our worst flight experience in over  years of flying  we were booked on ba scheduled to depart heathrow at  on  sept  we boarded  hrs late because despite the plane being at the gate we had to wait for a crew to arrive approximately hr into the flight the pilot advised that as the weather radar wasnt working we would be returning to heathrow where we circled for approx  mins before landing there was no member of staff present to offer advice about an alternative flights and the customer service desk stated they would not deal with it but we had to await an email an email finally arrived after about an hour and my husband and i were fortunate enough to be allocated seats on the  flight this time we boarded approx  hrs late again the plane was at the gate but we had to wait for a crew as a result it was around  am before we reached venice and the long wait for taxis meant that we didnt reach out hotel beyond mestre until  am weve since learnt that ba have cancelled hundreds of flights over the past several days claiming bad weather yet according to flightradar  no other airline flying out of heathrow cancelled flights
 trip verified  absolutely atrocious lhrordlhr roundtrip british airways is truly a disgrace as our national airline with only eight seats in first class you would think they could provide a genuine white glove experience instead the crew in first class both ways were inattentive illmannered and badly trained one gets better service in mcdonalds bas new first suite is a small uncomfortable cubicle and miles behind premium classes at other airlines movie selection was very poor and the wifi did not work properly the amenity kit was tiny and cheap the airplane itself was dirty and had clearly been cleaned in haste the food served in first class was grim and especially bad on the ordlhr sector the crew both sectors spent most of their time in the galley and disappeared after the meal service overall british airways continues to decline and one wouldnt fly them if there was an alternative to add insult to injury ba flies into chicago international terminal and has decided that the ordlhr return flies out of american airlines terminal  including use of the aa dreadful flagship lounge at t of course nothing will change because governments have given ba a virtual monopoly and ba continue to have mediocre leadership that only care about costs and their own share portfolio
 trip verified  as someone who flies relentlessly with british airways for business and pleasure generally for the routing and who is a gold frequent flier weve come to accept the shocking food service exorbitant prices and outdated planes when you get on a plane the primary role of the crew is your safety however when said crew look like they have just fallen out of bed cannot dress themselves properly or in the case of men find a razor you do question there ability to react in an emergency situation enough said
 trip verified    flew with british airways club europe on saturday st august poor lounge in berlin brandenburg airport emailed to say that flight was delayed with no explanation and no announcement made staff in lounge had not been told of delay and airport info screens were not updated email said to keep checking online for updates flight took over  minutes late with no explanation why the late arrival of plane and departure with a very rushed service on arrival at lhr quickly with passport control then an almost hour wait for baggage to arrive on the carousels no announcements due to the delay meaning arriving home over  hours later than should of been arriving
 trip verified    straightforward check in t new site for club check in and it works well all lounges busy but good food offerings on time departure for a completely full flight in all cabins sound food and drink offered with the exception of inferior quality champagne crew coped well for this busy and quite short flight slept for a few hours afternoon tea food was good but portions very small early landing and luggage off quickly
not verified  i am beyond upset and disgusted with the disregard lack of knowledge and lies that your company has put me through each call i have had with a different representative has lead to no help nothing being resolved and false information due to no longer being able to fly for my original flight i called and spoke to someone who gave me a new reference number where i could book at a later datedestination or change the name i then had a close family member pass away suddenly to which i then offered my mother my ticket to fly out for the funeral as i was told i could change the name when then calling and trying to do this i then got told that i was unable to do this unless we proved this by sending the death certificate as stated in the policy after questioning this and not wanting to get false information i made this representative double check and confirm this to which she did after then troubling my aunt and uncle who are grieving over the sudden loss of their son my cousin for this documentation we then sent it to the to email provided and called to get this now changed into my mothers name to which we then found out was yet another lie and that this cannot be done as you can only change the name if the ticket holder has passed away which makes no sense as they would be dead so how can they challenge a name change after expressing my feelings of mistrust that i would be taking it further as i no longer wanting to have anything to do with this company i was told that i wasnt allowed any refund and was only allowed to book it at a later date i then challenged the representative to speak to a manger to which i was told they had none working they had gone home and that no one had any direct email after then putting in a formal complaint  months ago with still no response i called back to use the money to book a new flight to say i couldnt as it was a less amount even after saying fine keep the remaining money and i was only allowed to book the same amount or more scam to get more money out of you when asking to speak to a manager shock horror there isnt one working when looking at the status of my complaint he said there is a back log and will get to it eventually says a lot if the back log of complaints is longer than  months to then be told there is nothing he can do i am beyond appalled hurt and frustrated by this whole experience and will be spreading the word and my story to every known platform and review website possible till i speak to someone who genuinely knows what they are talking about and can come to a mutual agreementresolve the issue as the information i was told only leaves me to believe that this company doesnt care at all about its customers and only cares about money and profit
 trip verified    i purchased round trip direct flight business class ticket for my family from hong kong to london a few days before the trip the airline cancelled our return flight without giving any reasons and booked us on a flight routing via doha which gave us  hour layover on the day of departure the flight was delayed by more than  hours as a result of crew shortage when getting on the flight we enquired about whether wed be able to make the flight and we were told that given many passengers are on the same flight the doha to hong kong flight would wait when we arrived we were told that our flight already departed and the next flight available was  hours later we had to wait  hour to get our boarding passes and then was only given access to the lounge when there is an airport hotel after the flight we reached out to make a complaint and ask for monetary consideration given the experience the airline has not responded for more than a month we paid up for the direct flight and premium seating but the experience was overall very poor
not verified  i booked two business class seats we had a medical emergency and couldnt make the first leg of the trip we then wanted to rebook an outgoing flight but were told that the entire travel was cancelled cost k of course we know that ba turned around and resold the return tickets 
not verified  although all four flights were delayed the service offered by ba was exceptional the food and drink offered on the domestic and international sectors was extremely good as was the attention of the cabin crew some disorganised boarding on return from newark the ba lounge service at newark was excellent overall a good and satisfying trip

 trip verified    you may never see your refund i cancelled my return flight and they sent my refund to pakistan and told me i must have a pakistani credit card i forgot i used to purchase my flight took  calls for them to admit this pakistan card wasnt mine and they sent someone else my money after calling about  total times over  months they finally sent me half my refund  and told me they dont owe me anything you told me what you owed me  on a  ticket sent it to pakistan and now you only owe me half that  
not verified  cargo service thats how i felt in the a upper deck supposedly nicer than the main deck for business but packed in on the  configuration head to tail as ba loves to configure its seats to make more money i failed to enjoy business class or feel like it was worth the money the lieflat seats do that as narrow as they are and only by lowering the foot restthe foot rest over which the person not on the aisle i was on the aisle has to step or crawl to get to the aisle one can get a couple of fitful hours of sleep but only with luck the seat controls on the a are primitive and antiquated the food served was a bit better than coach but only minimally so wellcooked dead supposedly scottish salmon salads with tough bits of green if id paid coach prices for this id have been sort of pleased but business class ba continues to hoover money out of flyers pockets for minimal qualityand charges all but their higher grades of customers for the privilege of choosing seats in advance of  hr checkin some of their newer planes have the more traditional allfacingforward business classbut many do not its really a gamble whether youll get a pod in business or simply a lieflat space next to many of your newfound friendsand be awakened by them its really time for ba to either reduce their business class prices to reflect the mediocre product or step up and reallocate space for normal business pod seats all through their fleet
 trip verified  inefficient and slow airport operation resting on their laurels many staff standing around doing very little at terminal  yet not completing their basic tasks  i had to return three times for them to properly do the document check fees as bad as ryanair for any extras average somewhere below easyjet above ryanair for now presumably thats what theyre aiming for
not verified   the customer service is one of the worst i have ever seen they will scheme and give you untruths we were not allowed on our original flight because of some technical issue on their end and had to call the airline because they could not do anything at the counter  additional later we are booked on the next flight in  hours we paid for services on the original flight and asked for it to be moved nothing happened we had to pay for the services all over again next the second connecting flight we sat on the tarmac for over two hours then we deplaned at midnight without going anywhere they did not even give us an hotel we had to spend the night at the airport they gave us a flight the enxt day from london to zurich but it was three connecting flights with an hour gap each london  brussels  amsterdam  zurich absolute nonsense the first flight itself was delayed so of course we missed all the other connections and they would not pick up the phone or help us nothing we had zero help from ba and had to spend  hours at brussels ariport sorting out and buying new tickets ourselves we are out over  at this point with zero response from ba to reimburse us for their planning our final flight to india from zurich was also delayed we sat on the tarmac for  hours before the flight finally took off costs
not verified  before my flight i was forced by the ground staff to check in my new expensive cabin luggage despite the fact that it met all size requirements i was informed that the plane was full and assured by staff that my luggage would be well taken care of unfortunately when my bag was returned to me it was scratched and damaged this is completely unacceptable especially given the assurances i received when i lodged a complaint it fell on deaf ears there has been no acknowledgment or resolution from british airways the funny thing is that the overhead lockers were empty this experience has been extremely frustrating and disappointing the lack of care for both customer property and customer service is glaring
 trip verified    british airways at its best outstanding service from the flight attendants dinner very good though breakfast could be better excellent ife the lie flat seat is extremely comfortable a very pleasant flight on board an a
 trip verified  an excellent flight despite this being a  hour flight in a a that is configured for short hops to edinburgh or glasgow and despite there being no ife i ended up really enjoying the flight i dont know if it was just that i had really low expectations but i thought the crew were fabulous and the food and wine was surprisingly good the plane itself looked very new and was in perfect condition from the very start i really liked the crew  they were all cheerful genuine and clearly enjoying their work i noticed they constantly had friendly and proactive interactions with passengers and when the food and drink came around they were generous with the wine  and happily provided topups later in the flight the food box was deceptively small  it actually contained a decent selection of food and was more than enough to keep me feeling satisfied on this trip there were regular and detailed updates from the cockpit which i also appreciated so whilst the hard products on this flight were limited it was the service  and the genuine enjoyment of the crew  that won me over
 trip verified  i recently traveled with british airways and had a mixed experience booking and checkin the booking process was straightforward but our experience at the baggage counter was frustrating while we were in line the three employees at the counter took a minute break before processing our luggage which caused unnecessary delays flights the flight to london was fine and we enjoyed our time in the lounge during our layover despite the delay the connecting flight to dfw was also fine baggage issues unfortunately our luggage did not make it onto our flight to dfw we arrived at dfw on wednesday  and as of  we still have not received our luggage customer service the most disappointing aspect has been the customer service they have been dismissive and no one has taken responsibility or provided a timeline for when our bags will be delivered overall while the flights themselves were okay the baggage handling and customer service has been horrible
 trip verified    my family and i were booked to leave london for hong kong on  august after having been made to wait at the airport for  hours we were told at midnight that our aircraft had bee struck by lightning and our flight was cancelled everyone was sent home we had to scramble to find transportation and were told to wait for rerouting information we were booked to travel two days later to hk via the middle east with an hour stopover needless to say we refused this flight the worst trick by ba is that all our original flight booking references were deleted from their system and we can therefore not apply for compensation of any of our additional transportation hotel and meal costs  i cannot find the words to express my anger not as much as an apology has been received 
not verified   we had to change from aa to ba for a flight to london because of a missed connection the flight was ok but in the process our bags were delayed we waited for  days at our destination reading regular unhelpful updates from ba about receiving our luggage and finally had to return to the airport twice to pick them up personally because no one lifted a hand to take them off the carousel we have now waited  months and counting for a claim to be processed this is absolutely the worst experience ive had in  years of plane travel the company has cleverly designed their website and phone tree to deter contact their live chat guides you by asking if you want to chat about a booking or something else in spite of entering no to the option about asking about a booking it takes you there anyway just like being on a baggage carousel with no one attending or caring at least im not alone judging from the number of similar complaints about how terribly they treat customers
 trip verified  after paying  for tickets for my family including having to pay over  just to sit together as we were traveling with kids they ran out of chicken dinners my kids are picky and wont eat vegetarian curry i dont mind the curry in fact i thought it was pretty good but at least maybe feed the kids first or check i dont understand how you can run out when we have to pay so much the only explanation to me is that the airline is greedy and will try to save a nickel than make everyone happy im just disappointed in british airways
 trip verified  an excellent flight on ba cityflyer the plane was clean comfortable and spacious crew were friendly and i was very pleasantly surprised to be offered a choice of complimentary alcoholic beverages on this one hour flight departure was ontime and i appreciated the cockpit keeping us updated and encouraging us to enjoy the views as we came into land at london city an easy and enjoyable flight  just as it should be
 trip verified    crew were amazing and attentive nothing was missed out by them will definitely choose ba in the future also have to praise the food the choice was sufficient and delicious for a short business flight
not verified   i flew internationally for the first time in my life and because of a delay on their end missed my connecting flight to my destination when i asked for help ahead of time i was told to run to the next gate needless to say i missed my flight there were three british airways employees at the customer service desk when i was next in line at heathrow and two of them went on break despite the evergrowing line due to multiple people missing their flights with the same airlines under similar circumstances after  additional minutes waiting for assistance i was given a receipt not a boarding pass which caused issues at the next connecting flight from barcelona to rome which was coordinated through british airways and this was just on the outbound trip on the return trip the british airways flight ended up landing  minutes late and landed while my connecting flight was boardingdownstairs from the exit gate i was denied entry to my connecting flight because i was  minutes past the time when they started to board because of the delay by british airways the boarding didnt close for an hour and didnt leave for another hour and a half later according to the notifications on my phone so instead of being helped i was denied entry because i missed the beginning of boarding by  minutes due to the connecting flight delay again i waited in the customer service line at heathrow to reschedule my flight i already had my boarding pass in hand i still havent made it to my final destination  i do not recommend heathrow airport either the british airlines employee came to me when she saw me upset after being denied to board on my return flight and asked what happened her solution to my problem was do not fly british airways in the future thanks a lot lady i already figured that out on my own i was given a  meal voucher bus voucher and hotel voucher due to the many inconveniences but i have not flown any airlines ever before in my life where i have had such issues  thankfully i had no checked bags so i cannot speak to that effect
 trip verified  ba after subsequent delays and postponed departure times from the initial  to  as passengers had been gathering at the already assigned gate crew was ready to board and aircraft ready outside decided to cancel the flight reason provided over the intercom absence of pilots all passengers were told that no hotels could be booked for them and that everyone was on their own note this therell be a follow up rage mounted amongst us all but the brits to whom all can be done without response myself and others had all reasons to insist and so we did till  am the crew kept saying that no rebooking was possible apart from the automated one which expected us to cross europe to get to our destination and no hotel booking were in their power either well liars after hours of pushing and raging one person came with the hotel bookings for roughly those  of us who kept on fighting liars also for another reason all but one angel told us there was no way to be rebooked but one took me apart and suggested me a way which worked it meant breaking some of their rules but after all they made the mess so they had to sort it out with  hours of sleep over  hours i managed to get back where i had to and im  committed to now avoid ba as much i shall be able to some of the clerks told me it was impossible working for them after all the cuts to save on money as the company runs in pretty bad financial waters hubs such as heathrow now have almost no presence and passengers have to do all by themselves from checking in their bags at the bag drops to spending hours on their phones at their expenses when ba messes it up as it frequently does lately its a pity to be seeing such a decay time to change leadership team and ceo
not verified    it is embarrassing to have the word british attached to this airline the service was substandard in every way with the possible exception of food and a couple of stand out staff i can accept delays and technical problems they happen how they handled it was in my opinion was not responsible  they left everyone on the plane for  hours and at midnight disembarked saying they had no hotels available and no staff to unload luggage the plane inevitable had people with young children and elderly all left to fend for themselves several times they mentioned dont worry we have a duty of care but there really was none singapore to london flight was not wifi enabled and they cram  business class seats across the width comfort and service did not reflect price and was well below leading airlines  avoid it at all cost
 trip verified  flight cancelled due to bad weather ba contacted me by email immediately and provided an alternative booking as well as a link if their suggestion for a different flight wasnt convenient clicked on the link and was assisted promptly by a service rep who rebooked me and sent all details within a few minutes great customer service from bawell done
 trip verified   british airways oversold my lhr to lax flight i booked months in advance paid in full and actually paid over  extra to fly their airbus a tried to check in online day before flight got unknown system error couldnt check in arrived at lhr  hours early none of ba kiosks worked all manual check in by understaffed ba staff who were all unhelpful insane queue times lots of other frustrated passengers in line denied boarding at the gate because flight oversold no explanations no apologies constantly ignored by ba staff who dont have the patience to listen to your situation or be helpful finally gate manager books alternate flight to paris cdg supposedly to connect with an air france flight we get to cdg only to be told by air france their flight was full no idea why ba manager bumped me to af flight thats also full thats insult to injury to be bumped twice went to ba desk at cdg no help at all they told us to call ba and couldnt even provide the phone number just told us to look online on top of all that my luggage is lost somewhere between ba and af in paris cdg im an american citizen and speak perfect english but i feel completely humiliated and treated like second class citizen by multiple ba staff through the whole ordeal mostly they just ignore you or bounce you from one counter to another without even trying to listen to your problem zero accountability will never ever fly ba again absolute worst travel experience of my life
 trip verified   i travelled london to doha on july th i had to physically check in at ba business t because i had an ongoing connection in doha and the flight was a code share with qatar i had paid for my flight through qatar and paid for the seat online so i could sit where i like to sit and when i got to check in discovered i had been reseated elsewhere in the cabin and was told that was their policy and basically to shut up about it i then discovered that ba do not recognise qatar frequent flyer rules despite sharing avios points im a gold card holder in qatar which affords me extra kilos on the baggage but ba tried to tell me i had to pay after some arguing eventually they accepted it the lounge was packed staff less than helpful when i tried to get some answers on my seat reassignment i was told i would get my money back  no chance of that so dont even try the flight boarded by bus the journey took  minutes to get from terminal to aircraft which i am guessing was at another terminal because it took so long to get there why not board us through that terminal rather than drag us all over the airport finally got onto the plane ba staff are not friendly its no wonder they are ranked th i now realise its a privilege being allowed to step onto a ba flight and it departed  minutes late myself and many other travellers had connections and this meant i was either going to miss the connection or i would manage to make the connection but my luggage wouldnt would ba flight crew help me on board to figure out the connection they eventually came to tell me me in their haughty attitude we are now landing  minutes earlier so that give you a full  minutes to make your connection landing early does not mean getting to the gate earlier it usually takes at least  minutes from landing to gate then another  for the jetway to be attached and if you are lucky to be sitting near the door straight off if not  minutes to disembark if you want to be helpful dont say stupid things to people who are frequent travellers as it turned out i was sitting near the door and had to run off the plane qatar were there to assist but i did have to run from the a gates all the way to c gates to make my connection not a short distance for a  year old and the luggage did not make it many others were not as fortunate and didnt make their connections why put a page in the flight entertainment for connections if you are not going to provide the information its public information you can look it up on line so the aircraft has access to wifi and satellite communication so i fail to understand why this information cannot be captured and displayed i complained to ba got a wishy washy email with a number of excuses in it no mention of the seat refund i got a paltry voucher that im supposed to use on another ba flight  who are they kidding i am not sure i want to experience that again however i have recently discovered that of my frequently travelled to destinations is really only serviced by ba if i want to fly at a reasonable hour of the day or go all over europe just to avoid them which is too expensive i consider them one of the worst airlines i have ever flown and getting worse by the minute fly them only if you absolutely have to and good luck
 trip verified   when dropping off my luggage at the luggage drop off at toulouse airport i had my travel pram confiscated from me and i was forced to take my sleeping  year old in my arms while traveling alone with him at am i was told by the staff outsourced by british airways to check in passengers that only yoyo prams were accepted on board i corrected her that it was yoyo type prams but she contested and told me that only yoyo prams would be allowed and if i insisted to keep my sleeping yearold in his pram i would not be permitted to board the flight to london this happened to  other families and we were forced to go to the oversized baggage area of the airport to clarify my pram is the silver cross jet stroller pushchair which i specifically purchased as it is conform to the british airways specifications i was then required to carry my toddler for  mins through security and then again for another  mins while waiting to board the plane i was allowed early boarding only to be moved from my seat to stand on the other side of the staff with no more options to sit down at heathrow i was then required to carry my toddler again for approx  mins to go through passport check and luggage claim as mentioned previously i was traveling alone with my child with no other support all this despite purchasing a very expensive pram to fit to your requirements and coming to the airport prepared with this pram im sure you agree this is unacceptable and it is illegal to force passengers to purchase a specific brand of products in order to be able to keep their child in their travel pram  in addition to this once on the plane i installed my kids fly safe cares child airplane safety harness for my son the cabin crew then proceeded to tell me this was not allowed i had to go on the website to show them that this was incorrect and i was in fact within my rights then for landing the crew had the gall to tell me to put the harness on my son and that it was mandatory to which i asked if it was mandatory why did i bring the harness myself british airways is the most discriminatory airline for parents traveling with children and this needs to change my advice dont treat a mom traveling alone at am with a sleeping toddler like rubbish and dont confiscate her travel pram that is within regulation forcing her to have the worst travel experience possible
 trip verified  if you cant fly first class dont fly british airways very uncomfortable seats you cant even get out of your seat when the person in front has their seat reclined and who doesnt need to recline their seat you cant pick up anything off the floor during the flight because you cant bend to touch the floor  there isnt enough space to if you have long legs dont think you are going to be comfortable  as soon as the person in front of you puts their chair back your knees will be crushed terrible food terrible plane terrible airhostesses terrible flight and unfortunately i have to fly back home with them
not verified    singapore to heathrow business class on an a is a premium economy plus experience from the economy class sized toilets to the badly designed coffin shaped business class pods  the experience is a substandard business class experience business class pods storage is a small drawer at the foot of the pod the privacy screens are opaque plastic sheets  so you are kept awake by your neighbour as their screen lights up your pod when the seat is made into its coffin shaped bed  the cold hard plastic seat moulds are an unpleasant surprise for those that turn in their sleep you have a choice of having your neighbour step over your calfheight footrest  hopefully not brushing your feet with theirs  or having to step over your neighbours feetfootrest with the footrest down  heavenforbid you try to lever yourself into a more comfortable position as the slightest pressure causes the footrest to collapse into its floor level position if you are in the aisle seat  which is open to the aisle  kiss goodbye to any privacy as not only will you be on view to all passengers  the crew will lean you to both serve your neighbour their food and talk to your neighbour over your privacy screen
not verified    i reported my damagedruined suitcase  weeks ago and im still awaiting a reply ill think twice about booking with ba again as the customer service is shocking to say the least ive followed up with british airways with at least  emails per week requesting an update but with no joy so far
not verified    on march st i flew from berlin to so paulo with ba but encountered several issues my first flight was delayed by several hours causing me to miss my connection at london heathrow upon arriving at the airport after midnight i was given a hotel voucher however the hotel designated by ba rudely denied me checkin claiming it was fully booked i had to return to heathrow at  am and found a different hotel paying for the taxi out of my own pocket as a result of these complications i arrived in so paulo more than  hours late despite my efforts to assert my rights and seek reimbursement for the taxi bas customer service has been extremely poor their phone lines are nonfunctional emails are only answered automatically and the appropriate channels for such requests have not been responsive since the first week of march this experience has left me extremely disappointed especially considering the high standard of service i once associated with ba
not verified  the worst customer experience british airways ba is effectively robbing people they are not here to help and show no compassion my partner and i fell ill and had a doctors note stating we couldnt fly ba said theyd hold our flight amount as a voucher valid for a year fair enough caveat to this which was not stated to us you must call them and it is not usable on holiday packages however using this voucher was a nightmare we cant use it for both our tickets because the original was longhaul and they refuse to refund half the amount bas customer service was awful and rude effectively stealing  from us this policy must stop we feel held hostage with no solution 
not verified    had to cancel my flight months in advance due to a change of schedule i was flying with american airlines and british airways selected seats and when i attempted to get a refund on the selected seats aa refunded me with no issue when ba refused despite both companies having similar policies avoid them fly with anyone else customer service is a joke taking over  weeks to respond to my email and giving me no further justification than what i was told on the phone
 trip verified  flight cancelled with no reason given less than  h before departure the earliest offered replacement on their terrible to use app was  days later which was unacceptable their phone lines do not work and would reject your call due to being overwhelmed even submitting a claim on their website is frustrating due to their terrible interface overall terrible company with wholly inadequate customer service
 trip verified  this is a route i fly regularly used first class security and lounge all good lounge surprisingly not so busy was great to see we werent departing from the dreaded a bus gate and the flight was on time boarded and ready to go on time and then six passengers were a no show a  minute delay to offload the bags and depart longer than the actual flight itself there has to be a better process for fast tracking this hence finally arrived in paris  mins late on the plus side the cabin crew were great and even had a personal welcome from the inflight manager which happens less and less these days
 trip verified   while ba may have made some positive improvements to its club world product its world traveler product and catering leaves much to be desired the first meal service was very slow more than  hours to serve the meal the portions were incredibly small  the chicken dish contained maybe  pieces of chicken  pieces of broccoli and a piece of unknown food small snacks were available during the flight but the real let down was the snack before landing in vancouver it was a bizarre tasting chicken pastry wrap which didnt have much chicken and did not taste at all like a pastry it was too sweet too mushy and too salty the seats although not exactly spacious were tolerable although the aisles are very narrow and cabin crew and other passengers frequently bumped into me while walking up and down the aisles cabin crew were generally responsive to passengers request and once or twice during the flight came down the aisles with drinks however the poor level of catering made for a very frustrating trip i certainly cannot recommend ba
 trip verified  british airways new club suite is a marked improvement from their older club world seats the new club suite offers a fair amount of privacy especially with the screen door closed and includes direct aisle access when fully reclined the seat converts into a fairly spacious bed although i found the surface on the side a bit hard and uncomfortable to sleep on the catering on board was fairly good and tasty  the appetizers and the main course were generally well cooked although the cabin crew were very slow with the meal service it took almost  hours after departure from vancouver for the meal service to be completed prior to arrival a light breakfast was served which contained a croissant a small egg and bacon sandwich and a mango puree bas catering on this flight was generally good unfortunately upon arrival at heathrow passengers had to wait over  minutes for checked baggage to arrive no explanation was given and not a single member of ground staff came to assist passengers or provide any information about when checked baggage would arrive this was a very frustrating end to what was otherwise a fairly enjoyable trip in club world and left a very poor last impression of ba
 trip verified   four very pleasant on time flights with friendly helpful staff the guy on the lhrsfo leg was exceptional and i regret that i have forgotten his name only negative was the food on the sfolhr leg the advertised filet steak was more akin to stewing steak and was inedible sadly this is not the only occasion i have food on usuk flights to be sub standard otherwise happy to recommend ba
not verified    we travel extensively over  years and tend to use ba on our regular trips where possible and in recent years we have had overall good service from them however more recently we have experienced flight delays operational issues flight cancellations poor checkin experiences etc on our last two recent trips one to zurich and another to iceland they had cancelled our return flight an hour or so prior to the scheduled departure time despite the flight showing as on time and no problems being reported we have just returned from iceland and our experience was one of the worst we have ever had with ba again our flight was just cancelled due to operational reasons but what made matters worse on this occasion was the flight was quite early at am we went to bed at around pm night before checked the flight and it showed as being on time with again no issues being reported so we went to sleep fairly rest assured the the flight would be fine we woke up at am and then discovered our flight had been cancelled without any warning we were then left with virtually no other return flight options for that day it soon got worse as the earliest flight option then being offered by ba was  days later we opted to choose tuesday with ba as we were left with no other option if we hadnt acted quickly the tuesday availability was sure to sell out leaving us with a return option of wednesday onwards having experienced the same problem with ba in zurich back in december we were lucky on this occasion as ba offered several flights back on the same day in zurich but this wasnt the case with iceland we were then left in a right predicament as hotel availability in iceland was very limited to non existent given the very short notice of our cancelled flight our hotel was fully booked and our hire car had to be returned to the airport from a logistical point of view this was a complete nightmare having to then rebook another hire car and to find alternative hotels we then decided to search for any indirect flights online to get us back to the uk sooner with another airline and after a good half hour of searching we came across an indirect flight into gatwick with norwegian air but it went via oslo and a total journey time of  hours this was not ideal as our car was in heathrow assessing our options which were virtually none we had no guarantees that the flight with ba on tuesday would also have proceeded on time and checking with norwegian air both flights were on time and looked promising so we decided to get these booked at an additional expense of  if we had stayed in iceland we would have also incurred additional cost to then fight back with ba or the insurance company our priority was to return home asap as we had important work and personal commitments on the monday so we had to return asap we eventually flew back fine with norwegian air and the service we received was far superior to that of ba the boarding process was slick on both flights compared to a complete shambles with ba norwegian air offered a full food trolley service with soft drinks teas and also a range of alcoholic drinks compare this to just the water and snack bar on ba both flights were on time and we eventually landed in gatwick shortly after our expected arrival time we got back very late home after having to then book a hire car at gatwick and in the morning we contacted ba to cancel our alternative tuesday flight 
 trip verified   flight delayed an hour due to bad weather around jfk however this was made up during the flight only to be delayed again by weather over lhr spending an extra hour in the americanba lounge at jfk was not ideal cold environment cold staff indifferent to the travellers needs one area was exceptionally dirty with plates on the tables and napkins strewn on the floor waited for a drink as no one to serve played a game of find the chipscrisps  which were hidden on a table in a dark corner in one of the  areas this is a crazy expensive route in business class and it feels like a rip off across all the airlines however the quality of bas business class has much improved with the introduction of the suites the privacy is a big improvement as too is the seat comfort and i managed a good hr sleep on the overnight redeye flight food service was very efficient for those that wanted it and did the trick so late at night aside from getting a decent rest on the relatively short flight the other highlight was the flight attendant unfortunately i didnt catch his name but he was superb being responsive to the few requests i made and remembered my name throughout the flight a small but very valued touch that is often missing with business class flight attendants on ba very good experience all round except the price which is reflected in my value for money rating
 trip verified   a very full flight made premium economy feel a little less premium than you should expect for the price however the smaller cabin configuration and slightly roomier seating made the journey relaxing enough catering was pretty good and the inflight service was efficient and friendly arrived on time and no delays with baggage delivery no complaints as pe served its function for the relatively short hr flight
 trip verified  the worst airline ive ever flown could not check in until my flight was open i was there  hours before flight not  days before asked if my husband could fly on the same flight he was also flying club europe but on a later flight and i could see online that there was room on the plane i was on the agent said they couldnt change his flight at the ticket counter never heard of that this could only be done online or by calling british airways i had already tried online so asked for a telephone number to call and the british airways agent did not have a number for me to call so i looked up and called several numbers online and all i got was the office was closed on saturdays i asked for the ticket agent again explained we were going to his mothers memorial and that and it would be nice if he could get on the same flight as i was on they still refused to help so he stayed on his flight which was leaving  hours later and then got cancelled and he had to spend the night in florence they re routed him on a flight to london via edinburgh and then they lost his suitcase you cant make this stuff up as for my flight  ba  i got several emails and messages advising me it was delayed i decided to go to the gate at the original flight time and guess what it was boarding on time i cant imagine the number of people who might of missed it its just an awful awful airline and i will never fly them again if i can possibly avoid them
 trip verified   i am surprised to be able to give a favourable review of the flight european business class is typically x seating with the middle seat on each group of three left empty leg room is never generous and ba is at the bottom of the generous barrel in this respect however on this occasion at least and as the flight is one hour that was not an issue cabin crew were great very professional and efficient cabin was clean and aircraft seemed pretty up to date i was surprised to find that business class was served an afternoon tea complete with champagne much nicer than the poor prosecco in the lounge we had three small sandwiches chocolate cake and a choice of plain or fruit scone strawberry jam and clotted cream on the side for those who wanted them it all tasted great i didnt try the chocolate cake and there was just about enough time to eat it before landing the crew worked very hard to complete service in time so well done them
 trip verified   flew british airways on ba  london heathrow to amsterdam i was able to check in at the ba first class check in area in terminal  and this is very fast and efficient the lounge was quite busy however i was able to find space the food snacks and drinks available was excellent as was the overall service i also like the ba first class check in area as the security clearance is fast boarding was a little chaotic however we boarded on time and the take off runway was close to the departing gate therefore no delays the flight itself was quite good as was the cabin crew and the meal service
 trip verified   ba cancelled the flight from tokyo to lhr i was booked on next day flight there was another flight on the same day i went to the desk but the flight was full ba in charge offers another flight through hong kong which would have been h flight time i declined that and asked to stay on the next day flight to my dismay he cancelled the next day flight without telling me he did that i think he was annoyed that i didnt accept the offer after he spent sometime looking for in fact i am the one who should be annoyed for cancelling my flight i ended up flying another airline with downgrading poor service and appalling behaviour you expect better from ba
 trip verified  i strongly advise everyone to never fly british airways i know we will never do so again we had business class seats booked for an early morning flight from heathrow to sf  and then the flight was cancelled the evening before the flight we luckily checked email before we went to bed and found out it was canceled we then called ba and after waiting  minutes someone to answer the call the person who finally did said he was going to move us to a united air flight leaving an hour later from heathrow to sf the next day he told us the flight number and said he had booked us business class seats it took a long time to get it all worked out so we got just a few hours sleep that night but it looked like it was resolved then however when we got to heathrow early the next morning we found that the ba person did not complete the booking as needed and united could not give us seats they said we needed to call ba to get them to complete the change but despite numerous attempt we could not get anyone to answer the phone at ba this went on for  hours finally by the grace of god after hours of stress trying to figure out what to do we found a united ticket agent at the airport who personally called ba for us and got then to fix the problem so after being at heathrow at  am we ended up leaving for sf late that afternoon totally exhausted the united air ticket agent saved us and allows us to get home she also said these problems were common with ba 
 trip verified  my partner and i were on the ba return flight from tampa to gatwick and i was very excited as had paid for a upgrade to business class my partner flies bc with ba a lot for work but this was only my second time we decided as it was the end of our holiday that have this will help us get some quality sleep unfortunately that was not to be also in business class were two families with children under  it was a very long flight listening to a toddler not just crying but screaming for seven out of the eight hours now its not the childrens fault i do however think that the cabin crew could have maybe internvene and helped a little more but also ba should have informed us as we paid alot of money and quite frankly could have saved that money and just had economy ticket as at least we would be a few grand better off what with that and how the checking in ground staff were treating us as if we were an inconvenience we will rethink ba moving forward
not verified   we had a premium economy return flight los angeles to london the outbound flight was cancelled with under  hours notice and we had to instead take an economy flight via dublin to london thats annoying but it happens what is really difficult to understand is bas response since i raised this as a claim once our return flight had completed as i was instructed to do it is now nearly  months and there has been no response other than one in early march with the title weve not forgotten your case and were really sorry youre still waiting for a response from us we know its been a long time since you contacted us and this isnt the service you should expect rest assured weve not forgotten your case our customer relations team are working extremely hard to respond to you as soon as possible thank you for your continued patience you can check the status of your case here please accept our most sincere apologies we look forward to speaking with you soon i called about a month ago to enquire and was told id be hearing within the week this is just extremely poor customer service in addition to the inconvenience and stress of the latecancelled flight delays and change in class of flight british airways really seems to be on the decline i have so many friends who are longtime customers like us who are having flights cancelled or delayed with little commitment to make it right i have been a member of their flying club for  years is this how you treat loyal customers ba
 trip verified   i should like to review my flight with british airways from hannover to london heathrow firstly the website was very easy to use however i object to the policy put in place with regards to having to pay for preferred seating checkingin online was a very easy process other than being presented with the fee to select a seat at the boarding gate in hannover the staff were superb they insisted that people with larger bags turned over the bags for checkin i was included in this the staff were very fair and polite and imposed this policy evenly and in a firm but polite manner the flight took off reasonably ontime the cabin crew were very good and coped really well with what was an entirely full flight the now usual small bottle of water and a tiny snack the size of a uk p coin were issued to the passengers on this flight the captain was very vocal in the nicest possible way he oozed a sense of professionalism and was well spoken with clear and informative announcements disembarkation was orderly however the cabin crew were nowhere to be seen when leaving the aircraft given that this was a very short flight and given the full nature of the flight too the cabin crew deserve an applause for their professionalism this experience has turned around my less than positive experience with this airline a few months ago well done to the ground staff and cabin crew for making this a pleasant and civilized journey
 trip verified  we have flown with british airways a few times but this last trip was by far the worst experience we werent able to check in online because the system wouldnt accept any of our passport info so we had to wait to check in upon arrival at the airport we arrived two hours before our scheduled departure the line was backed up with only  stations being staffed where there was room for at least  more attendants to help expedite check in we talked to a few people in line and they too were unable to check in online it took the desk attendants an hour to check in the people ahead of us we told the agent we had tried to check in online but it wouldnt accept our passports she replied it was because they need to verify each passport personally i asked that wouldnt they verify them that way anyway i also let her know we attempted to move closer to the front of the plane and could see there were seats available but couldnt secure them because we couldnt finish check in she went on to tell us its a full flight so we wouldnt be able to choose our seats we reached the gate and ask the agents there about moving to another section and she confirmed there was no availability during the flight the service was not what we expected based on previous flights we only saw the flight attendants during food service and twice to pickup trash every time i went to the lavatory there were at least  attendants standing around chatting instead of taking care of the passengers the attendants seemed uninterested and inexperienced even snapping at a confused passenger regarding their seat belt the flight attendants were disappointing to say the least no available air control vents above us so no option to have any air flow other than what the whole plane had upon landing we went to the baggage carousel to claim our bags an hour later still no bags finally a message came over the loudspeakers that the elevator on the plane was broken and the eta of the bags was still unknown about  minutes later the bags started to slowly appear on the belt overall this was the worst ba flight weve experienced
 trip verified  i sat in the plane at vienna airport for three hours and didnt take off after arriving in london i was sent on my connecting flight only to be told that the plane had already closed and that i should go back to the other terminal i was then flown to johannesburg with virgin and when i arrived my luggage had not been taken i only received it five days later i have been waiting for compensation for nine months never again british airways
 trip verified  it is almost pm we were supposed to take off at  we are still sitting on the plane at the airport the worst part is not the technical issue that has kept us grounded but the fact we have only been offered half a glass of water the entire time we have been on board being hungry and dehydrated has not helped the situation
 trip verified   i booked a long haul flight to singapore with british airways because i thought i could rely on them to provide good and reliable service unfortunately this wasnt the case hence this review knowing i would be able to fall asleep watching movies or tv shows on their in flight entertainment system was something i was looking forward to on this overnight flight however my console didnt work and instead i had a loud screaming toddler in the seat behind me that kept kicking my seat and some babies in front only two hours into this already hell of a journey were we told that we should buy the wifi pass for which we will get fully reimbursed i followed up several times throughout the flight with the cabin crew who assured me they will take a note of my seat number and someone from customer service will contact me with reimbursement this wasnt the case after waiting for several days i contacted them myself and instead of the  reimbursement that i can use towards a nice meal on holiday theyve given me  avios i never want to fly with them again so why give me service points when i was told by cabin crew i would be refunded  the only reason i even bought this wifi pass as its not even good enough to watch anything with because the connection quality is so poor what a waste of a flight and  these are  hrs of my life i will never get back and forever remember i will remember ba as the brand that once was that no longer is their cabin crew seemed overworked and overwhelmed and even when you pressed the attention buzzer no one came if you can avoid booking with ba go ahead 
 trip verified   a premium price for a subpar product  flew ba  lhr and hkg and return in may we had originally booked when the aircraft was allocated the club suites  paid for seat selection a couple of months prior to the trip the aircraft was changed to the  layout with the yinyang seat configuration we had been allocated  of the  middle seats so paid again to select the window and aisle the hard product is poor  the seat space lacks any form of storage that remains accessible when the seat is in the flat position  nowhere to put specs a book or phone additionally the window seat passenger has to climb over the feet of another passenger to use the toilet etc  really poor layout the planes on both legs of the journey were tired and shabby the crew on the outward journey were enthusiastic and helpful  the return crew seemed less adept at managing the service the outbound catering was acceptable  but the presentation on tiny plates does not compare favourably with competitors the catering inbound was very poor the welcome champagne was truly awful this is a poor product at a premium price  and sad to say this pair of selffunding passengers wont choose to repeat the experience the lounge at heathrow on the outbound sector was packed to the rafters and was a poor experience very disappointing
 trip verified   really terrible user experience british airways website is full of glitches i cant even choose my own seat due to cookie problems never had this problem with any other airlines 
 trip verified  very impressed with ba check in online was a little convoluted but once through that everything was great we flew in standard economy and paid to choose our seats  this seems to be standard for all airlines now and how they keep initial prices down but worth doing so we could sit together meals were excellent and drinks great a simple water and biscuit on our short internal leg but still included and then  drink  main meal and  snack on our  hour leg was better than our last trip on emirates they gave out double drinks at drink service  that was  cokes and  beers for my partner and he was well pleased staff friendly bags transfered and arrived in good condition and entertainment on route was good too will definitely choose ba again over other airlines
 trip verified   lhr  sfo las  lgw august  in club world its a shame that the british airways experience is split into a mixture of fantastic ground and cabin crew and dated products and dreadful after service our flight to san francisco was on an a the interior of which was showing its age two of our  seats had issues  would not recline the dividing screen to the next seat would not stay up and the other was temperamental with its recline and the ife would not respond to the controls crew on board were great but the dated and aging product for which top dollar is charged for should have been upgraded years ago a shame for such a great aircraft coming back from las vegas to lgw on an tired  we were informed at check in that there was an issue with the seats we had prebooked and paid for and that we would need to be moved seats we were moved to were fine and worked the original seats had people in them and they appeared fine flight was late landing and departing due to weather conditions in vegas but the aircraft was turned round in a super quick time  which was impressive where ba have really let themselves down is the after flight experience after   months we got an acknowledgement and avios credit for the issues on the flight to sfo we are still waiting  months later for the avios points we used to pay for the seat selection to be refunded for the las vegas to london gatwick leg of the flight despite numerous attempts to contact they havent got back to us our avios account page through ba wont load our recent transactions and does not list the flights weve taken in the last  months wont be travelling with ba for a long long time now  dated and poorly maintained on board products and appalling customer service
not verified    i flew from malaga via lhr to boston on the th may  and on arrival in boston discovered my luggage was still in london filed a report and now  days later no sign of the luggage the baggage customer service is a joke not interested in the clients or giving a good service updates are useless i know my luggage has been sitting in boston since the th as i have an air tag inside it the airline seem to have no intention of getting my luggage to me the robots on fb messenger  twitter are useless i opened a complaint  when i checked the update of my complaint the case had been closed despite never been contacted by a human this airline is now a joke and if i ever get my luggage back i doubt i will ever fly with them again they are now worse than air canada in my book and that is saying something
 trip verified   milan to miami return via london worst business class ever the layout of a of ba is crazy the width of seats is outrageous aisle seats are a shame for ba length is ok but you have to jump over the legs of another passenger when heshe is in sleeping mode unbelievable the system of dividers up and down to reach all seats by crew is absurd and awful never again with this layout meal was below average from lhr to mia while the return was quite good unfortunately for ba i flew in march with qatar airways business class and not comparable just to highlight the difference ba row has  seats while qr has  seats thats it on top of that the service is quite strange mainly due to dividers above boarding procedures look well organized at the beginning then during boarding become quite messy
 trip verified   ba created a new lowcost subsidiary in ba euroflyer for flights out of london gatwick from a passenger point of view this is meant to mean no difference in service from ba mainline shorthaul out of heathrow however it is most definitely inferior firstly is the seats  ba promised to keep their old much more comfortable pinnacle seats up to row  in their refurbishment of these planes with slimline seats however at ba euroflyer it seems the whole plane has these installed on some planes despite snagging a seat in row  we ended up still with those horrible back breaking seats that have no lumbar support and no headrests one positive of the new seats was meant to be atseat power to charge devices but this didnt have that either the onboard service is meant to include some complimentary food and drink namely a sweet or savoury snack and a small bottle of harrogate spa water what we got was horrible nairns raisin oat biscuits without asking if wed like the other choice and no water on the return flight it was explicitly announced wed be offered a glass of water for free but this was not offered during the service the snack was sole choice of a pack of mcvities milk chocolate digestive hardly premium and downgrade from some of the more alternative and upmarket offerings weve received when flying from heathrow on the way back we did have nonrefurbished plane with pinnacle seats this was welcome however clearly the plane is not maintained as one toilet had no water flowing from the tap  very irritating when you soap up to wash your hands after going to the toilet i went to rinse my hand in the other toilet luckily it wasnt busy the tap was working but the sink wasnt draining and almost overflowed lastly the cabin crew on ba euroflyer are very unpolished look miserable and extremely demotivated a lot of them a very young were talking late teens and clearly very inexperienced and not likely to stay long under the conditions offered to them ba really needs to rethink its product offering in shorthaul  ultimately people choose to fly with them for variety of reasons but invariably there is a reason like us they dont fly with their lowcost rivals because they want peace of mind less stress and to be comfortable so replicating the likes of ryanair easyjet or wizz air is just alienating as a customer because we choose ba to avoid the kind of experience they offer we were on an award ticket but looking at cash tickets theyre not even cheap nor offer better timings than those rivals despite all this beancounting
 trip verified    i flew with british airways from heathrow to hannover although the checkin process was relatively quick there was a noticeable lack of staffanother apparent costcutting measure by ba upon arriving in hannover i found that my luggage hadnt made it to the airport and there were no staff to assist i had to file a report online the following day i received a call saying my luggage would arrive on a later flight but this didnt help me since german shops are closed on sundays leaving me without essential items as a result i was confined to my hotel unable to attend any planned events because i didnt have suitable clothing when my luggage eventually reached the hannover airport i got a call from ba informing me that they couldnt deliver it for another day or two they advised me to take a taxi to pick it up and said i could claim back the cost but when i submitted my claim ba refused to cover the taxi expenses they also declined to offer compensation for the inconvenience caused by the delayed baggage even though it disrupted a full day of my trip service on my return flight from frankfurt was also below par from the ground crew at frankfurt airport who were slow  rude at check in bas customer service has declined significantly now resembling the level of budget airlines like easyjet and ryanairbut at a premium price given my recent experience i will avoid flying with ba whenever possible 
 trip verified   manchester to copenhagen via london on th april  aircrafts were a and a respectively both in decent condition i arrived from africa and had to transit and change terminal to t which is very cumbersome and tedious checkin was quick easy and professional got my desired seats due to silver status at ba from t i had to go through one of the worst security checks ever encountered fragmenting almost every item in my carryons their escape lounge in t is quite decent particular beer choices and prosecco sparkling wine food was very poor neither any savoury snacks nor meaty food at all good tarmac view first flight was delayed forcing me to catch the nd in lhr within  hour however i was informed clearly at gate upon arriving in lhr assisting me on next gate and the airline managed to transfer the luggage in this extremely narrow timeslot onboard only a minibottle of water and some bagged crumbs were given fairly useless and superfluous no ife or wifi annoying charity beggings from fas on both flights are intrusive annoying disrespectful and degrades the airline offerings onboard like discount carriers except being pricier arrived final destination on time and so did my luggage
 trip verified   i have never seen such disrespect to a customer it was the rd time in  months that i was unable to do a checkin because of their website not working properly lost  hours on the phone with their customer service team at the airport i was asked to check in my hand luggage because they had no more space in the cabin i could not recline my seat and the staff was rude and unhelpful to me the wifi was also not working i made multiple complaints and no one ever even contacted me never using them again
 trip verified   paid for a  hour long flight ticket which includes use of the inflight entertainment system ended up in a seat where the inflight entertainment system was malfunctioning and could not be used at all flight attendants sought to perform a service recovery through their customer relations team contacted by the said team slightly more than a week later with an offer of an evoucher that can only be used in purchasing additional flight tickets with ba explained to them that i had no intentions of travelling again within the next two years so i had no use of an evoucher and sought for an alternative form of compensation instead something that could really be useful instead customer relations simply brushed my request off as them unable to offer any alternate gesture of goodwill  compensation in british airways is a matter of goodwill pay for a ticket but dont get what you paid for in full compensation is one that requires you to spend even more money on the airline so that they can disappoint you further an ultimately selfserving inconsiderate undiscerning and insincere compensation which in itself isnt even anything they feel guilty or remorseful about because any compensation is a gesture of goodwill something you dont deserve in their view 
 trip verified   very inconsiderate pa announcements were made by a purser who appearingly decided to exchange his career at ba for comedy club acting although not at the right setting first prelanding pa my colleague and i had a very long week with british airways so we are dimming the lights as we dont want you to see our faces if you are afraid of the dark  just look at the passenger next to you although clearly not the pursers intent it sounded like a mocking and very careless of people with aero  darkness phobias who may have a panic attack after such a joke very inconsiderate and damages bas brand as a safe accessible and a trusted airline second pa after landing was if youd like to make a complaint go call easyjet i felt genuinely insulted by this joke ba charged an abusive fee in the end i literally had to beg the rude and dismissive ground staff in madrid not to check my roller bag at gate because i recently had surgery and needed to hold onto it to walk instant noodles which i purchased onboard were barely edible all cabin crew except from one disappeared at the galley where they were loudly chatting and laughing and looked at me as a nuisance even when i just wanted to pass through them to visit the lavatory and then the chief purser effectively announces that if anyone is unhappy they can go fly someone else wake up ba you are already worse than easyjet and ryanair in terms of value for money i note that only ones who found the pursers jokes funny were the other cabin crew who made a few vulgar laughs while passengers remained dead silent i can understand airlines scaling back services to cut costs i will never understand how you can allow your staff to openly mock and insult your passengers i am a ba silver member and have been a loyal ba customer for years a disgrace
 trip verified   absolutely terrible lost my luggage on both flights delivered  days later smashed to pieces a lete departure caused me to miss the connecting flight yielding a  hour delay the aircraft was oversubscribed dirty with an unpleasant persistent odour food was genuinely horrible im ex forces ill eat almost anything usually 
 trip verified   we booked premium economy round trip from phoenix to zurich via aa codeshare and operated by british airway on our way return flight back to phoenix february th the first leg of the ba flight  between zurich and london heathrow was delayed departure which cause us missed the ba  connection flight between heathrow and phoenix first problem is that when we dash to the terminal  security check point at  pm the airplane was still at gate and will not depart until  pm if it will be on schedule we had almost  min at that point however the terminal  security stopped us and was told we cannot pass thru the security due to airline requirement we later realized that flight  did not leave until  pm we were directed to the customer service to rebook the flight when we got to ba customer service transfer counter there was only one agent available there were least  passengers waiting in the lines we were told ba was short of staffs due to british holiday during end of february and there was a soccer championship match that sunday so it took us at least an hour and half to rebook the same flight next day also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to phoenix on different flight on the same day then the agent who rebooked the flight told us his printer was broken and we need go to zone  of terminal  to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed we found zone  and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggage will be on our next day flight with us as well we also told there was a shuttle bus around the corner to take us to the hotel however no map or detail direction provided it took us a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal  by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired next day we arrived at airport few hours ahead our scheduled departed time  pm i noticed my checked two bags not in the same spot based on my iphones find me feature i had apple air tag in each of my checked bags so i checked with the gate agent she confirmed with me that only one checked bag was associated with my flight luckily the flight was delayed two hours so my other bag made to the same flight while on the flight the team of young flight attendants were generally pleasant but they missed to service me meal i did not order any special meal and the popular chicken dish was not available when she came to my row so i told her any chicken dish will be ok and she told me give her few minutes and she will bring me a different chicken dish however she totally forgot that and only when she came back to collect the trash i mentioned to her she forgot my chicken dish she was surprised and acting like i was lying to her overall i think my premium economy flight on ba is the worst experience in recent memory as the british flagship carrier they seem dont care i emailed my sent my experience to their customer service they responded with a standard corporate reply from one of their email templates
 trip verified   we chose rotterdam and london city airport because of convenience both small and having a hotel in the docklands meant a short distance from city airport three hours before our departure our flight was canceled however disappointing but we made a swift move to amsterdam schiphol airport but unfortunately we were offered a flight to heathrow which meant almost  hours by tube to our hotel flight back operated out of lcy to rtm but had a  mins delay so in terms of punctuality ba is not very reliant the flights were okay with a snack and a drink the e being far more comfortable with  seating and more legroom than the a our extra expenses for the cancelled flight were handled promptly and we got all the money for extra transport and food back so ba did a good job in this respect but hesitant to book again though they are the only airline flying between rtm and lcy
 trip verified  the entire booking and ticketing experience has been stressful and erroneous i booked directly with ba as i thought  why go to any other airline when their home headquarters is uk and i need to go to the uk mistake this was months ago i could not cancel or change my flight without paying them  to cancel my flight and have that money sitting for just  year on account otherwise all was lost minus a few hundred in taxes as whom i am really flying with is american airlines and another partner i cant check in without being redirected then those sites dont recognize me i dont appear in aa or aer lingus applications i couldnt ask for more time to change planes in london despite all reviews saying how long and hard it is as that would mean a cancel of plane ticket  loss of all money ive been on the phone with agents for over an hour on  different calls their app will not let me in without each time a reset of passcode a  minute wait for the email and then i get the same error
not verified    british airways cancelled my flight less than  hours before automatically rebooked it for  days later i called customer service  times trying to change it and they would not help my daughter was flying on a different reservation and because i am legally blind i needed to be on the same flight  they didnt care nor would they help we eventually bought new tickets on easyjet when we arrive home i entered a complaint to get my fare refunded it took them  months and then the response was it was cancelled because of a strike in spain so they wont refund it easyjet didnt cancel the whole experience was awful and so disappointing
not verified  i wanted to write this review so i could give a huge thank you to one of the staff on lisbon named jay ramphul she went above and beyond and really helped me in an urgent situation i had boarded my flight with  minutes before take off when i realized i had left my cell phone in the club lounge i was not going to get permission to deboard and get back on in time for take off jay stepped in and made it happened she literally ran with me a far distance to retrieve my phone with me and get me back on the plane within minutes of take off this is true service i dont know if this review will ever get back to her or her management but i hope it does i want to again express my gratitude for her help and kindness in this matter
 trip verified   check in fast and friendly security a breeze lounge was busy early evening but comfortable and clean flight attendants welcoming seat a nightmare it was the reverseforward with a step over from the window seat who the hell thought that was a good idea meal were ok but all curry based like curry and i was on a flight to india so fa was brilliant as the only flyer awake on an overnight flight improving since my last ba flight
 trip verified   this is the first time i have seen the new club world suite the seat was comfortable but unlike other airlines ba has crammed as many seats in business class as is humanly possible so the cabin felt cramped the crew behaved as though we the passengers should have been grateful for them turning up for their shift they looked scruffy in the new uniforms clearly the dress code policy has been scrapped i appreciate that appearance is no measure of service quality in the uk alone but the service was appalling the menu lacked choice and the food was presented as if it fell to the floor and was scooped back onto the plate the bedding was atrocious an old scraggly blanket and ill fitting seat cover i was cold and asked for an extra blanket which never arrived there were no drinks coasters obviously cutbacks so my drinks kept spilling i decided to clean up myself as the crew couldnt be bothered and didnt pick up on the fact i was using bathroom hand towels to act as drinks coasters to mop up the mess the aircraft was old although retrofitted and had a leak by the galley wall with lots of blue roll in situ to mop up the mess not at all a premium service this felt more like a low cost carrier doing business
 trip verified   flew business class from doha to london on st march the service was slow and unfriendly even one of the male cabin crew working in business class asked the female cabin crew who was looking after the area where i was in to smile i ordered waffles for breakfast and they looked like theyd fallen off the plate and had been thrown back on see photo the plate that the waffles were served on was so hot that when i moved the plate i burnt my finger i wasnt warned that it was ferociously hot i was shocked at how bad the food presentation was but didnt feel comfortable saying anything to the cabin crew as she wasnt approachable or friendly for lunch the bread roll was so dry and rock hard that i couldnt cut through the ends not sure why the food and service was so bad on this flight as generally ba food is good and is well presented also the wifi wasnt working on the flight
 trip verified   starting off at heathrow terminal  check in was fairly easy but fast track security was terrible the area is currently under refurbishment but there are only two scanning machines in the fast track area and at this time only one was in use so the queue was long and very slow moving ive heard mixed things about the ba club lounge but i was fairly impressed food options were fairly varied and tasted really nice nice salads as well as pie and veg drinks as always in ba lounges are very easy to lay your hands on and cater for most wants lounge was a decent size with various seating options and wasnt very busy at the time i went sunday evening boarding was well organised and club passengers  higher tiers was boarded quickly and easily amenity kit bottle of water and bedding were waiting at the seat welcome drinks were provided fairly quickly after sitting down hot towel provided after take off shortly followed by drink and nuts as has been regularly said these nuts would be infinitely better if served properly not in a very small packet food service on board consisted of a main dinner service which was served  hrs after take off then a breakfast meal before landing both meals were genuinely delicious all meats were tender and juicy and very was perfectly cooked drinks were provided whenever asked although crew were too busy serving all passengers to proactively offer top ups breakfast was offered to passengers as they woke up which meant that people ate when they wanted rather than just in order almost but not quite like a la carte dining crew were friendly and efficient with some nice personality coming through this is fairly standard of my experience with ba in flight entertainment was excellent good screen quality responsive touch screen excellent selection i did not use the wifi however it was available on this aircraft and prices are reasonable i think the seat is generally very comfortable and the storage compartments are convenient and spacious enough the crew on my aisle side of the plane forgot to unlock all the doors so people had to work out how to do it themselves or periodically request the crew to do it for them whilst you can never complain about a fully flat bed the reverse herringbone layout does make the footwell a bit cramped and also means its a lot more comfortable to lie on one side rather than the other facing away from the door i did manage a few hours of sleep though so not too bad overall a really lovely flight and absolutely holding its own as a decent business class productservice
not verified   we have flown this route with easyjet regularly for more than twenty years but at the age of  boarding at nice has become so chaotic and wearing l decided to pay the significant extra amount to see if ba was better the outward flight from heathrow was not great but acceptable but when l attempted to checkin for the return l discovered that we did not have a booking at the time l booked l was recovering from a serious illness and assumed that l must have made a mistake after considerable panic l booked last minute flights at considerable cost with easyjet boarding being the usual shambles flying into gatwick rather than heathrow the only way to get home was a  taxi rather than a  bus fare from heathrow on arrival home l discovered that i did have an email confirmation of the return flight from ba so immediately contacted them to complain and ask for financial compensation in the two weeks since they have sent two apologies for their slow response but nothing else so far we have elderly friends who say that they now find travelling with british airways so stressful that they will not travel outside the uk again this will help the environment but it seems remarkable that the airline industry in the uk has deteriorated to this extent unfortunately jal or singapore both of which l have used happily over many years do not fly within europe
 trip verified  a last minute business trip to hnd a route i regularly fly overall a good experience in the new club world offering which personally i like and find to have plenty of room although some say it is a little tight i arrived lhr in plenty of time and used the first class wing as i am eligible due to exec club status great to see the security lane reopen and efficient due to the new no need to empty your bag scanners additionally the first class lounge was not as busy as usual so a nice experience boarding was from gate a by bus probably the least enjoyable part of the journey its not uncommon for this flight to use a which baffles me as such a large number of passengers need to take the not so scenic journey past all the a gates b gates and finally c gates before arriving at the aircraft even passing a few empty airbridge gates on route boarding was not well organised with no real announcements they started checking in peoples bags and preboarding with no announcement which then confused people who thought it was general boarding and started moving forward group  was then opened before i got to the front on the queue group    began boarding from a separate line and there were too many people waiting to board the buss so not enough room once onboard the aircraft was clean and i like the ife offering in the new club world unfortunately i didnt find the crew particularly welcoming or engaging i know its a lot of passengers and a long flight but there was not much smiling or customer service at one point i had to walk through the galley to the toilet on return  crew members were talking one in particular was blocking my way and after looking at me proceeded to continue and didnt offer to et me past eventually the inflight manager moved him to one side so i can pass on another occasion i went to request a drink and was effectively scowled at in a look that felt like what do you want and why are you disturbing me other than those points a generally good flight and on time arrival to hnd
 trip verified    overall i would say disappointing due to ba status i had lounge access on the small side and very busy the aircraft used a remote gate boarding was not well organised by group status as it should be but i did manage to make my way onto the first bus of  on arrival at the aircraft the plane was still being prepared so we had to wait on the bus after  minutes or so everyone was becoming a little irritable as it turns out the inbound flight had a number of complex wheelchair passengers that needed assistance which was delayed and took a long amount of time when it did arrive after  minutes waiting on the bus we finally boarded the aircraft the captain apologised for the delay no mention from the crew seat was standard euro traveller the service was okay but the crew were not particularly engaging when i tried to order a coffee due to the seatbelt sign being on as a result of some minor turbulence i was told it wouldnt be possible as the crew member reached two rows behind be the seatbelt sign was turned off but they didnt come back to ask if i would still like a coffee overall we arrived into lhr  hour late no tug to move the aircraft in lisbon and had to wait for the gate in lhr disappointing but not the worst flight i have had
not verified   lhr to delhi in business exceptional flight stylish and quirky b gates lounge with interesting modern and eclectic food plus whispering angel bar food on board was delicious and well presented friendly fun relaxed crew with a blend of deference selfdeprecation and over familiarity been flying ba for  years in various classes and this was probably the best great job ba
not verified   efficient and smooth flight from start to finish cabin crew attentive and bubbly very clean aircraft mcvities snacks a nice touch and even the coffee in a bag was unexpectedly nice everything to praise and nothing to complain about
 trip verified  was told we can not take hand luggage onto the plane as all overhead cabins were already full so had to put them in the hold when we at the aircraft door frustrating as we had just hand luggage to avoid delays at heathrow then the bags did not arrive at the baggage belt and after  mins waiting had to spend another  mins filling in forms etc was told the bags are still in madrid so they know that all the time and did not have the decency to inform us before we waited for them to arrive  hours later no communication from ba such a terrible and unnecessary experience and so badly handled by ba there were many people who had bags that were too big for hand luggage hence the cabins were full before everyone had boarded which is unfair and then not helping by informing us of the fact they did not leave madrid is a double level of incompetence
not verified   the flight was comfortable enough but with an hour delay on the return leg however on both leg i was told i had to put my very small and expensive cabin case into the hold as the flight was full having done so i was not amused to see other passengers bringing much larger cases into the cabin ba should stick to their cabin bag size limit and not inconvenience those who comply
 trip verified   we had a really good flying experience with ba travelling as a young family of  the flights left on time and we even arrived early for nearly each one of our flights food was generous and quite tasty for economy class with the crew coming around with waterdrinks throughout the flights our checked luggage also arrived safely and undamaged both at vce and our return flight to yul on all of our flights the crew were attentive friendly and helpful with us and our children especially the gentlemen who served us on the return flights from vce to yul on march th the b interior is really dated and really needs to be updated to compete with their european counterparts there were panels squeaking loudly when we hit turbulence seat covers coming off the seats and tray tables which were not level and loose for eating the ife on the b worked fine but it definitely wasnt as responsive and did not have a newer larger screen like the ones on the b thankfully the b have had their interior updated but the one we flew on had a clogged sink in one of the lavatories which created problems for passengers unfortunately on nearly all of our flights there was garbage left in the seat pockets and the floors werent quite as clean on the incoming flight to lhr the b was not assigned a gate because we arrived early into the airport which resulted in significant delays for the airport buses to get to the plane and also slowed down the deplaning process we would definitely consider flying transatlantic with ba again as we received value and service for the fare we paid
 trip verified   waited an hour to checkin at the paphos business checkin staff utterly incompetent flight crew in business class removed my ruck sack from the flight bins without my consent to make way for another customer luggage i was then coerced to have my luggage at my feet throughout my flight utterly outrageous last thing you would expect in ba business class
not verified    not a great experience at all from the outset it was poorly managed as they bused us out to a parking slot only to have us wait for  minutes in the bus as the plane was ready ba business class is not business class tired small and generally not worth the ticket price tables that dont sit straight arm rests that arent secure and terrible screens its not a patch on first class airlines which is apparently where ba think they should be they have a long way to go
 trip verified   boarding was difficult caused by vast majority of the passengers carrying too much hand luggage fas were friendly the seats on ba for european flights are extremely narrow there was a choice of breakfast and very surprising the champagne castelau on european flights is of a better quality as the brand used in club on intercontinental flight nothing wrong with this flight however not pleasant due to the unpleasant seats waiting time at brussels for luggage some  minutes what is very acceptable
 trip verified   boarding started with a delay of some  minutes  everybody could see members of the team only did arrive  en  minutes before the announced boarding time we had to wait outside for nearly  minutes  it was hot  unfortunately flying from barbados to london in club class was an underwhelming experience ba is not performing a great performance on international flights anymore lucky the  had the new configuration as welcome aboard champagne or fruit juice the glasses were filled at the level of one inch a far cheaper brand of champagne heidsieck monopole and no more ros champagne available wines also poor there was no french wine cognac is also not available anymore my meal was sub par  the steak was replaced by beef stew and the fa made it very clear  dessert or cheese not both after some  hours flight there was no more ice available minimal information from the flight deck breakfast not suitable at all for a business class some of the fa were friendly others not at all far from pleasant experience despite the high fares 
 trip verified   absolutely horrible customer service  will never fly again we left toronto for london and then missed our connecting flight from london to mumbai  so we had to book with a different airline and pay the costs they then cancelled our return flight  weeks later from mumbai to toronto without notifying us we just happened to find out when we tried to check in on the day of we are now stuck in mumbai with  small kids no return flights  first and last time flying with them
not verified   ba is not what it used to be as much as i like their onboard crew their check in staff lacked interest in their job and safety at no point did he make eye contact or ask security questions and counters opened  minutes late crew from cph was wonderful but announcements were too loud and too many  maybe i was just grumpy took less than  to get out of lhr through self service and transfer to lgw was a breeze crew on the pos sector was ok had an aisle seat and was bumped into by a cabin crew booty continuously for  hours not her fault but could never relax fully one caribbean crew excelled and joined the carnival spirit most passengers were feeling onboard i wonder if ba management ever tasted the food onboard absolutely tasteless and some of the worst i saved  choosing ba over klm which was the only reason i chose them klm is definitely a league over ba in many aspects and no need to change airports
 trip verified   ba first its not even the best business class in the sky cabin very long in the tooth service extremely inattentive and lackadaisical been waiting over an hour to be offered after dinner drinks or dessert nothing just awful value for money
 trip verified   the worst business class experience ground crew in singapore were friendly i ended up switching lounges from ba to qf the aircraft was late  hour the cabin crew in business class were some of the most unfriendliest crew i have experienced no one smiled not welcomed on board no body was checking though out the flight if i wanted anything i found my seat sat down and waited for someone to offer me a refreshment nobody came a stewardess approached a passenger sitting infront of me if hed been offer a refreshment he said no i looked at her and made eye contact she looked at me and walked straight past observing some of the other passenger the crew did not assist any of the ladies struggling to put their carry on luggage in the overhead during the entire flight all the staff felt like they hated being on the flight and did not want to work when disembarking walked past  crew not one was saying goodbye and thank you to any passengers the food i had was average i had a cocktail it was ok the wine selection was below average
not verified   quite possibly the worst business class i have ever flown in  it barely rates as premium economy and ba shouldnt be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in europe on these routes ba has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline buyer beware there is no point in upgrading to business class other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first the seats are extremely uncomfortable and they cant really be reclined there is no in flight entertainment not even an app which many discount airlines do use for regional flights once upon a time ba used to be a good airline and maybe it still is for longhaul but its truly awful for shorthaul and is a fivehour flight actually short haul might as well save some money and just book a cheaper airline staff are courteous and professional the issue is the quality of the product for the price
not verified   i will never be flying with ba again this is my first and last i was flying from singapore transit at sydney and then to auckland my destination firstly there was an hour delay for the flight from singapore that was fine i received an email in advance and could just head over slightly later i confirmed with the staff at singapore that ill make it just fine for my connecting flight since it was just an hour delay vs a few hours in transit i arrived in sydney the flight was fine and the ba staff were decent i knew that it was close to my boarding time and so i rushed through the checks to get to my international transit flight  we were ushered downstairs to catch the shuttle bus after queuing for such a long time they scanned my boarding pass and said that i was taken off this flight i was not notified prior and had to find the transfer desk and request for a rebook of my connecting flight i rushed over as quickly as i could to waste no time the lady who was a qantas rep told me that i needed to speak to a menzies rep about this matter she gave me instructions to find a menzies rep i rushed to the boarding gate of an asiana flight to speak to a menzies rep but they were busy boarding the passengers so i waited by the side for all the passengers to board only to be told to head to another transfer desk to rebook my connecting flight there were other disgruntled passengers when i arrived the next available flight was at night this meant that i arrived at am at sydney and had to wait for close to  hours to get on the next flight as i did not have an aussie visa did not need one as per my booked flights i was not granted a day stay and was given a meal voucher and was sent off to hunt for a good place to restsleepnap many cafes and restaurants rejected my meal voucher by the way but i finally got food ultimately my rebooked flight was delayed again by another mins the stress anxiety fatigue and hassle caused by bas poor rebooking system ive filed a formal complaint and request for compensation and were waiting to hear back 
 trip verified   on the my trip to mexico city i had the opportunity to experience ba longhaul business class for the first time and it was extremely underwhelming first of all boarding to our flight to mexico city was done with buses every inch of the bus was filled with passengers and we couldnt even breath the club world experience is not personalised and it doesnt make you feel special the flight crew were giving the welcome drinks as if giving free food at a food bank and i wasnt offered a nonalcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin the same rude serving attitude happened when the flight attendant was serving icecream midflight on the way out he literally threw the ice cream to my head as i was in the middle seat that is covered from all sides that makes flight attendants hard to reach  the most striking issue with the cabin is the state that the seats are in they were their old style yinyang seats and they looked pretty old with no storage space and most functionalities are working with a struggle my entertainment screen was not working well and it was quite unstable when the flight attendants were playing the security on my way out neither of the seats in my area playing the safety video and the flight attendants had to redemonstrate the security instructions manually on the way in the crew opened my screen for security demonstration but it kept closing in when i asked if there is a way to keep the screen open the flight attendant joked saying i will tell the pilot to fly with an angle so that the screen is pulled down and it will stay open  i found this attitude unacceptable the screens were old and bad quality  i was quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board they looked great on menu card but were quite bad when they are servedi would not recommend ba business class product based on this experience
 trip verified   i upgraded at check in to club europe seat d and had an excellent experience with ba the checkin at the airport was very quick and smooth with friendly staff once through the fast track i headed for the galleries lounge at lhr t and this exceeded my expectations the food was really good and i had a superb view out over the runway the flight was great some people have remarked that legroom isnt good even in club europe but i found it fine for a  hour flight afternoon tea was delicious cabin crew were excellent i was out the airport in about  minutes from landing ba did a superb job on this flight
 trip verified   i bought a return trip with ba through webjet australia last year i would fly from sydney to porto middle of june with no problem but i had to return earlier to australia so i requested a change in the dates from march to january i should point out that ba partners changed the details of the return flight many times that is not a problem the problem is that although i was flexible with the dates they refused to fly me back i had to buy a ticket from another company to travel to australia later i asked for a change of the return date to january of next year again that was turned down i will keep in mind this negative experience with ba when booking future trips
 trip verified   poor from start to finish six months after purchasing our tickets i added an extra bag at the exorbitant cost of  but this transaction failed to make the system i rang ba customer services only to be cut off without a reply at lhr a manager had to be summoned to verify my printed receipt of payment i was assured there would be no problem on the return trip wrong same experience at lis on board an hour delay because of late discovery of technical fault old plane with an uncomfortable seat with minimal legroom soggy cookie and small bottle of water offered free return trip even more uncomfortable seat made worse by the extra recline the passenger in front of me enjoyed due to his knackered seat once upon a time ba stood for something no longer next time it is tap with their much newer planes
 trip verified  communication and customer service non existent they make me pay for seat on my return flight from madrid to london where didnt should be as my ticket was premium economy on the time of check in just was able do bamad but to not madlhr just in madrid they issued boarding pass changed my seat from f to f worst seat ever explained rudeness on madrid  plane changed that section is business and you are premium only we send you to the back no apologies no answer complaints low cost airlines treat you better refund of seat received but zero apologies
 trip verified   that was supposed to be my flight but it was cancelled  hours before takeoff after nearly  months ba finally responded to my compensation claim confirming i was due statutory compensation another  months later and still not received it despite chasing according to ba my bank must have lost the payment so now apparently my problem again from my experience a once great airline now with customer service no better than the worst of the low cost carriers
 trip verified   have no fear when your ba flight is operated by finnair the business class seats offer more leg room than the ba offering and the service just could not have been better food ba was good too excellent flight arriving so much ahead of schedule that there was a delay disembarking as there was no one available at lhr to pilot the bridge
not verified   we have flown ba five times from western usa to england always decent service never again if you have a problem their website is impossible to navigate its terrible  takes you in endless repeating circles and loops that never lead to any resolutions they lost our suitcase we spent hours upon our arrival in lisbon trying to navigate their website it was frustrating and fruitless three days into our trip and we still are waiting for our clothing and toiletries and electronics can we talk to a real person no its impossible we have even quit thinking about the  we spent to secure seats in economy that turned out to have no extra legroom we paid  extra for nothing we are done with ba whoops not quite we still have to get home
 trip verified   london heathrow to istanbul at the start of the halfterm school holidays and so the flight was very busy indeed boarding was quite well managed with neatly presented and pleasant gate agents one of whom went out of her way to assist an elderly passenger with mobility issues i felt singled out by a member of the ba crew who insisted that my small bag was taken and checkedin other passengers had large bags and were not stopped from taking them onto the flight during the flight i felt that a staff member was very unprofessional towards me i had an aisle seat and he spoke at length to the couple sitting next to me about their country of origin i may as well have been invisible the same member of the cabin crew then disappeared and returned with a selection of drinks and snacks from business class for his compatriots he managed to spill some liquid on me and did not even acknowledge me  the a was clean no ife and not even a routemap to follow the journey it was a rather clinical flight and exceptionally basic i received a small bottle of water and two broken digestive biscuits the wifi did not work and the ridiculous skyshop was not accessible either i asked for a coffee and the cabin crew member kissed his teeth at me is this how low ba has fallen i also noted tension between the same member of the cabin crew and  of his colleagues this is not good enough disembarkation was remarkably orderly and civilized and the captain made an effort to engage with passengers during the flight with sensible updates
not verified  jan th i booked a lastminute transatlantic flight to ireland to attend a funeral for a close friend of mine so the nature of the trip was bad enough as it was it was not a vacation for me on the transatlantic leg of the flight ba was the airline it was a terrible experience a baby was crying right next to me for a good portion of the flight thats not bas fault but just to continue to set the stage midflight they had to close both the bathrooms in the middle of the plane i was in seat j right behind one of the bathrooms they both started leaking sewage into the passenger compartment i could see the water coming toward me and soon it was under my feet as you can imagine it didnt smell great it made a bad trip worse and got all over a new pair of boots i contacted ba about this and explained in great detail what had happened their response was essentially sorry about that i contacted them again to verify that this was the formal response they responded by offering me a  euro voucher to use on a future ba flight which has very little value to me if any i contacted them again giving them another chance to make it right nothing its not their fault that there was a screaming baby nor is it their fault that the restrooms overflowed created a disgusting mess and soiled my boots it is their fault that they made no effort to make it right this is not just an inconvenience its a health and safety issue as far as i can tell im the only one who got sewage under my feet i think this is completely unacceptable and will do everything i can to avoid flying ba in the future
 trip verified  i am a british airways gold guest list member with lifetime privileges in spite of that i have given up britsh wherever possible i take ten or more trans ocean trips a year i am fortunate to be able to fly first class  unfortunately british no longer has a first class product  the sell one by that name at first class prices but in fairness deliver what you would consider a very good business class experience i should point out that there are airlines who sell business class that in fact are better than any british first class experience qatar emirates i have flown many millions of miles on british last week i completed an around the world trip on emirates and qantas all a in the millions of ba miles i never had an experience as good as what i experience on ek and qantas a very long time ago the food and beverage service on ba was truly extraordinary  today it would be a bit of a stretch to even call it ordinary  so sad a decline seat comfort in first lounges food beverage all need serious rework if you are a first class traveler british is just not an option sad truly sad
not verified   another case of reviewing british airways flights that they have not actually provided i booked several months ago for london to casablanca via madrid with the madrid to casablanca leg on iberia returning from marrakech direct on ba first the marrakech flight was cancelled so i had to rebook on royal air maroc now ba has changed the london to madrid leg to be operated by iberia so instead of my booking through bacom having  out of  legs operated by ba i now have none of them being ba flights  and they did not transfer my paidfor seat selection on london to madrid so i have got to arrange a refund of the payment what is the point of an airline offering a service and taking your money for that service only to decide later that they cannot be bothered to provide what you have paid for in good faith only giving  out of  because i cannot mark it as zero to reflect the zero service received
 trip verified  on the memorable day of january th my family and i embarked on a journey from london heathrow terminal  destined for glasgow little did we anticipate the series of events that would unfold shaping our travel experience into a tale of exceptional service and unwavering dedication as we navigated the bustling corridors of the airport our journey encountered an unexpected hurdle it was at this juncture that i found myself grappling with booking complications compounded by banking delays amid this quandary i sought assistance from british airways personnel at terminal  hoping to salvage our travel plans enter mr sathies a beacon of hope amidst the chaos with a demeanour exuding empathy and professionalism mr sathies swiftly assessed the situation at hand despite the setback he wasted no time in springing into action exploring every avenue to mitigate the impact of the unforeseen challenges we faced the sequence of events unfolded with remarkable clarity as mr sathies tirelessly liaised with various stakeholders including senior colleagues and his managerial counterpart mr gurvir singh dhillon their collaborative efforts culminated in a solution that exceeded all expectations through mr sathies unwavering dedication and mr gurvir singh dhillons steadfast support our travel arrangements were salvaged without incurring any additional costs despite the initial uncertainty my family and i were able to proceed with our journey embarking on our flight to glasgow with a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional service rendered by british airways as i reflect upon the precise sequence of events that transpired on that fateful day i am filled with profound gratitude towards mr sathies mr gurvir singh dhillon and the entire british airways team their meticulous attention to detail and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction reaffirmed my faith in british airways as a paragon of excellence within the aviation industry
not verified  i did not actually get to fly with ba as they cancelled the flight with  days notice and refused to offer an acceptable alternative resulting in  people losing their holiday a river cruise since then as appears to be their standard protocol they have ignored every communication regarding their obligations for compensation and i have no option but to pursue them via official channels 
 trip verified  we had possibly the worse checkin experience ever this ever it took nearly  minutes of phone calls and numerous staff to check us in for a redemption flight through our account utterly bizarre situation for a procedure weve done without hitch for the last  years once onboard we were so disappointed to have the old style club world seats that meaning stepping over your fellow passengers to use the toilets why on earth are these still in use they feel so dated the saving grace as is quite often the case was some fabulous cabin crew that were amazing i have fed back to ba direct to sing their praises fingers crossed for the return leg
 trip verified   i flew to lhr from ath in club europe with ba on dec  to transfer to a jal flight back to tokyo at first i had no great expectations of what services i would enjoy on board partly because its flight time was less than  hours and because the seat configuration of club europe was the typical european business class with the middle seat empty afterward on board remembering that i took the same route with ba more than  years ago i got to feel relaxed by their unobtrusive and courteous services when i asked for a champagne refill a couple of times a benign smile would come to me
 trip verified   i like the british airways world traveller plus product the seats are comfy and the food is good the crew on this flight were very attentive and friendly especially the csm who came round and introduced herself to us and made sure we were comfortable the bars closed half way through the flight to cancun as they cant uplift more alcoholic drinks in cancun juice water tea and coffee is available very full flight my only criticisms of british airways premium economy is that it feels like they actively try and split families up unless they pay the  each to pre book seats the majority of drinks are served in plastic not glass there were no inflight snacks available on an  hour flight its an upgraded version of economy where as other airlines like qantas and singapore airlines are business minus still worth the extra though
 trip verified   i have come to boarding and my cabin luggage was taken because the plane is full i asked to take it to the cabin because i have large notebook and  electronics in it but nothing changes so now i am sitting in the plane holding notebook and several packs from my luggage and think of how i will stand with all this stuff in my hands in a passport control line in warsaw other people around me have come to the plane with cabin luggage
 trip verified  stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to miami four of us from one family were travelling british airways business i am a british airways gold card member i have been a member of british airways executive club since  we only ever fly british airways in first class or business class it has become a habit to fly ba and we do this because we trust them for safety we have regular long haul flights booked with british airways in both first and business into next year we often fly to the usa both my wife and i used to have virgin atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to ba because virgin did not have a first class seat product even so the service from virgins gold card department was off the scale absolutely brilliant and we loved the virgin lounge at heathrow our flight to miami with british airways was on one of their double decker aircraft these are just too big and i believe contributed to the appalling service perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however whether in business or first i now view ba aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky the food is not much better however our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies changing nappies within the business class cabin instead of doing it where they should be doing it in the wc try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo there must have been three or four babies having nappies changed regularly in our cabin i can put up with the screaming because that cant be helped but not poo cabin crew did nothing about it despite being asked i telephoned ba customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in manchester ba office who told me that she was ba cabin crew for many years she told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal my wife and i are flying first class british airways again to the usa in april and we also have first class tickets to the usa booked for december i sent in a complaint to ba customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled british airways on december  to miami from lhr and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful i received a response offering a  voucher or  avios so given the cost of four business class flights to miami from london british airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin at  per passenger given that i am a gold card holder an extremely good customer clearly in the top one percent of all ba customers and a gold cardholder if that is how they behave with me god knows how they behave with everybody else all i can tell you is that flying with virgin atlantic when i was a gold member was highly positive when our children were young we used to fly ba first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin not in any cabin when i complained to british airways i asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question i have numerous business class flights booked with ba over the course of the next  months as well as first class flight booked 
 trip verified  worst service ever lost baggage because of delayed flight and missed connection and no one is helping to get it back british airways website is broken so it doesnt let me fill missing report and doesnt give me missing file report number and so no way to contact british airways because they have dumbest ever ai chatbot
 trip verified   ba  jan  did not appreciate the unprofessional attitude of the pilots flight scheduled departure  advised boarding time  whole flight full of passengers waiting at the gate to board at   the cabin crew board  the pilots board  each with a sao paulo airport duty free branded shopping bag  the flight is still boarding finally pushes back just before   minutes late captain came on the intercom to announce the delay was due to traffic between the crew hotel and the airport sorry captain the whole plane saw you and your pilot colleagues board fifteen minutes after the cabin crew clutching your duty free that you and your pilot colleagues still made time to stop for
 trip verified  not a great experience i could not check in online as two separate parts of the ba computer system do not talk to each other at lhr a delightful check in clerk sorted it quickly manually we boarded on time but luggage loading had to be halted as the captain spotted a technical issue and an engineer was called by the time it was sorted we had missed our slot so took off an hour behind schedule the flight was uneventful but the plane had clearly seen better days legroom was appalling and the handout of a small bottle of water and a soggy cookie made one wish for the days when flying ba meant something special next time it will be jet
not verified  i was excited to fly ba as id not travelled with them long haul for over yrs ive travelled to australia on many occasions so ive pretty much travelled with them all terrible was my experience ba have become the ryanair of longhaul travel riding on their previous good name and reputation we were delayed for hrs at the terminal where we were offered one glass of water and then at the last minute our meal  with no additional drinks offered the charging points were outdated and  out of  didnt work family of five travelling the in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines the food was atrocious  we flew ba lhrhongkong and return and cathay hkaustralia return and the comparison was vast we were offered pre meal drinks and snacks drinks with our meal a menu for our flights so we knew our choices the quality of the food was vastly better with cathay our luggage was lost for nearly two hours in hong kong and when we arrived into london one of our bags was so badly damaged it was unusable the only redeeming part was the crew on our return flight were amazing severine was an angel and helped make the journey more pleasant for my kids
not verified   i just want to warn everyone of the worst customer service experience ever it really looks like british airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them last week we called british airways to make a reservation for the family at the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from american express the representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account and asked us to contact american express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made the conversation was recorded by british airways and could be checked we immediately called amex within  minutes and solicited the transfer of k miles amex clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible we said that it was fine since we had checked previously with british airways we then called british airways immediately to make our reservation to miami they confirmed that the miles arrived to our account but to our surprise they told us that there was no space not even one seat to miami and that we could not use the miles we explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles but all this went on deaf ears we called the german office which was absolutely unhelpful so we also called uk customer service which was just as unhelpful no manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status in the end british airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem did not give us a solution kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to miami with this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business every time we call they made us wait for over  minutes then they answer and put us on hold i have  days of waiting and talking with british airways for over  hours each day we were on the line for over  minutes each time we were told by the lady agent to hang up the phone as i was too long on the phone and she had other customers and we are not customers they never help us
not verified  paid for business class travelling cairo to london heathrow but all i got was an economy seat only difference from economy is middle seat was vacant couldnt recline no entertainment for the hr flight uncomfortable seat and disgusting food put in a formal complaint  days ago and had no reply bas account on x is hacked got approached by scammers after posting there and even after flagging this to ba nothing done about it just disgusting avoid 
 trip verified   the plane was extremely dirty with chocolate smudged all over mine and my childrens seats i had to wipe down all the seats after we landed i immediately realized i left my camera with its bag in the airplane overhead cabin they would not let me back on the plane for security reasons so i went to the british airways team on ground  they refused to contact cabin crew only until we threw up a massive fuss then the manager reluctantly agreed which by that point cabin crew had disembarked now its been over  weeks with no sign of my camera so it is assumed stolen i have complained to british airways and all i get is an automatedgeneric response to keep checking with lost property zero customer service for their regular customers and this all could have been mitigated if they had been willing to help at the very beginning  very disappointed
not verified  overall journey wasnt bad however at the end the baggage arrival nearly took  hours more than actual flight time baggage of other flights arriving after had been delivered whereas the baggage staff on airport had no clue and information as to why baggage of this flight hasnt arrived they raised their hands saying they cant do anything further poor communication and no customer facing skills
 trip verified   overall very satisfied ground staff member at yvr was extremely helpful  courteous a was only a few months old so seats were in good order  comfortable by the standards of a modern day y class seat although the very small washroom was already starting to look a bit shabby cabin crew very friendly  professional  meal service carried out at reasonable time in the flight choice of  options for the main meal which was the same for both legs of my journey  month apart flight departed on time but unfortunately upon landing at lhr we were unable to deplane for quite some time due to a staffing issue at lhr which so not the fault of the airline and we were given frequent updates on the situation from the flight manager  the flight deck
 trip verified   as always when i fly ba it was a total shambles i was booked manchester  london  madrid  ba first leg and iberia nd i try wherever possible to avoid ba however the manchester  london was late however i ran for my ib flight and got to b gates just as boarding started being group  i went to board and the gate sounded an alarm ba had removed me from the ib flight to a ba flight  hours later as ba had reissued the ticket ib could not put me back on the flight so  hours wasted because of bas total incompetence this airline is a total disgrace the crew were not nice typical ba crew oh im so fabulous i dont need to be nice to paying passengers club europe cramped and terrible food 
 trip verified   first time using ba business class but we were pleased with the service received no one was waiting at check inbag drop and through security in  minutes we used the lounge in the b gates area which we found quiet with plenty of food and drink on offer boarding was quick and the cabin was on a xx layout with  seats although there was a larger bc cabin behind that had about  seats again food and drinks were plenty full and good quality service from the cabin crew was excellent and the cabin manager lauren even made up a birthday card when she found out it was my wifes special birthday departed early and arrived at jfk early as well the only thing that i disliked was paying  each to select our seats and no free wifi
not verified   extremely rude ground service we were nonrev flying and london was our connectionlayover gate agent was extremely rude and forced me to check my carry on suitcase with the explanation that it was oversized however when i put it in the sizer it fit perfectly without force the plane was not fully booked and had lots of room overhead the gate agent was insistent and rushed us with no regard for the fact that we would have to redo security in order to get our bags again as we were switching airlines and needed to carry them on due to our nonrev status the flight itself was good attendants were polite and helpful no complains there just extremely unhappy with the gate agent service i understand that it is not a pleasant job and frankly i would not be overjoyed to work there either but that does not explain why we had to be inconvenienced with no fair explanation or attention
 trip verified   my son and i flew to geneva last sunday for a skiing holiday in les arc the flight was cancelled moments prior to boarding and we were transferred to a flight departing three and a half hours later that then got delayed by a further three hours they didnt load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passengers who had been on the earlier flight problems happen its a complex operation what is totally unacceptable is the service one receives when there is a problem the offshore call centres are unhelpful and obstructive wanting to fob off issues by getting the customer to call special help lines that merely refer one to a webpage and then cut off the web pages are often unable to give information as they are not updated and often refuse to update your inputs at this time please try again later there is no access to people that are willing to help empowered to help or actually move a situation forwards in any way weve been sitting in a hotel waiting for the bag to arrive for two and a half days unable to ski due to our entire wardrobes being in the cases the outdated luggage tracking system had the suitacase in geneva  days ago where it sat with noone willing to step up and get it delivered what an incredibly heartless and incompetent company 
 trip verified   for the price paid bought during a sale it was a decent experience although the club class business class seats offer no more legroom than economy class using shorthaul fleet on a  hour flight fast track through security was not honoured the lounge at istanbul airport was overcrowded as it is also open to the public who can pay for usage causing a long queue for entry  which was badly organised boarding was smooth cabin crew were friendly but their service was hitandmiss eg some people got a welcome and some didnt half of the cabin was automatically offered coffee after dinner but not the other half however drinks were replenished generously and regularly and the meal was good with a choice of three mains from the menu
 trip verified   flight left on time and arrived over half an hour earlier than scheduled thanks to strong tail winds the flight was full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at heathrow so for  and a half hours we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snacks nothing at all available to even buy to eat worse than a lowcost carrier experience in this sense one of the light panels overhead the seats towards the back of the plan was broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passengers head for the whole flight poor maintenance of cabin i would choose another airline on this route in the future as one of their competitors offers full meal service on this route even in the economy cabin
 trip verified   very poor business class product ba is not even close to the other airline leaders which ever way they sell the seat on a  it is a  layout the cabin feels and is very cramped the food in business class is economy quality just served in a china dish however the price of course is at premier levels the only positive of the whole fight and return were the cabin crew who were fantastic i felt genuinely sorry for them having to try and flog such a poor product would i fly ba business again only if their were no other options and i had no choice
not verified  this review is for lhrsydlhr ba and ba business class had a  configuration on  giving space privacy and easy aisle access seat reclines into comfortable flat bed good quality pillow and duvet privacy with sliding door good storage space around the seat and charging point flights on time  no delays gluten free meals were very poor in quality and presentation warm processed meat between two bland slices of gf bread apparently is a business class breakfast on two sectors the main course no choice offered was bland fish which was served in a single small tray covered with foil  in business class condensation had formed as the dish was reheated probably from chilled so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid one crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal do ba also serve the same gf offering in economy economy plus and first on a long haul flight my advice if gf  take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of ba for  hours my travelling companion had very good regular meals or so they told me with a choice of main course on the same flights crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basics and rather than welcoming and engaging usual hospitality industry waffle about service but little of substance delivered
 trip verified  absolutely pathetic business class product ba is not even remotely competitive with other international airlines in the business class market with old outdated  across seating  no i did not make a typing mistake  you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access the crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the  center seats ba like most other europeanbased airlines does not have a factual intraeuropean business class product even though they promote  sell business class intraeurope flights feature the same  seating throughout the aircraft  the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in business class  passengers get a meal  drinks but this does not justify the higher cost bas transatlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the narrow  across seating the biggest surprise on both the lislhr  lhriah flights was that ba has in fact substantially improved their food quality shocking unfortunately it is served in the worst business class configurations of any international airline i have flown the entertainment  system  small screens  my laptop screen is twice the size  is like an airline offering  decades ago the flight crew was pleasant  perfunctory which is about the best one can expect from a ba crew ba will simply never match the quality of carriers like singapore emirates qatar etihad eva ana japan air new zealand qantas or many others ba can compete with usbased airlines like delta american  united which are also not even in the same universe in terms of a highquality business class product one of the biggest slaps in the face is that ba expects business class passengers to pay to select seats even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class several hundred us dollars for transatlantic flights only if you wait until  hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost certainly another ba management decision that was made without a functioning brain
not verified   overall not bad staff look tired and overworked trying their best weird seats i was in g going and d going home the buttons to press for the seat recline are so stiff i had to get help on both flights to get them to work there is another button also very stiff to bring the leg rest out this is an awkward thing which doesnt come up far enough to be of any use at all for your legs but just obstructs your feet really again i had to get help to activate the very stiff buttons at one point the lady next to me was pressing the buttons for me while i tried to recline sit up or put the leg rest back we gave up and called the flight attendant who also had trouble ba please give this some maintenance food only one out of three menu choices available by the time it got to me in premium ec it was pasta and was not too bad a christmas turkey dinner was offered but why not load more if it is so popular that it is not available  minutes into the meal service breakfast was an unidentified soggy pastry thing in a cardboard tube it was disgusting same offered on return journey a cold pastry and fruit would be so much nicer the tea and coffee was hot at least overall i would say air canada provides a much superior premium ec service than ba i wont choose ba again
 trip verified  this was our first flight with british airways in over  years and as usual i couldnt fault them as we were connecting we had little interaction with ground staff  staff in the lounge were friendly and helpful cabin crew on the flight were great  very welcoming and friendly our meals were delicious  no shortage of drinks being offered the seats were economy seats with the middle row blocked off and some recline we arrived into stockholm a little early through a snow shower which was a nice welcome back to stockholm bags checked in at jfk were delivered safely within  mins of arriving
 trip verified  i recently encountered a highly disappointing experience with british airways specifically regarding their customer service after my initial flight leg was canceled i was rebooked with a connection at london heathrow reduced to a mere  hour and  minutes realizing the impracticality of this i promptly contacted british airways within  minutes to request a more reasonable layover of  hours shockingly the customer support representative flatly refused citing an inability to change my flight despite explaining the logistical challenges of a short layover and a terminal change requiring additional security procedures i received no assistance to add to the frustration the representative inaccurately noted on my account that i was presented with multiple options during our conversation moreover the use of military time format and the lack of initial options provided only exacerbated the communication issues both phone and email support proved equally incompetent and i was informed that customer service is outsourced to india allegedly contributing to the subpar service this experience has left me not only struggling to rebook my flight but also with a strong resolve to avoid british airways in the future the lack of assistance blameshifting and overall incompetence in customer service make it my worst experience yet i strongly advise others to steer clear of british airways and their appalling customer service
not verified   beware ba dont provide any refund due to a very serious medical reason my father was diagnosed with a severe heart defect a couple of weeks before his flight date and ba refused to give any refund as this was not a good enough reason we sent them a medical note from his doctor saying he is unfit to travel due to potential heart failure and needs to have heart surgery as soon as possible and the operator totally dismissed it they said only thing they can do is change the travel date within a year heart surgery recovery takes months and its highly unlikely that he will be able to travel within the year meaning he would lose his ticket and money they said they cant do anything to help not even change the name on the ticket so someone else can use the tickets the most ridiculous thing ive heard
 trip verified   check in was chaotic and badly organised even though there were two desks one for premium and one economy there ended up being just one queue in front of the premium check in even though most passengers in it were economy that meant that those travelling in club or with higher status had no separate queue to join whilst i was waiting in line another passenger went up to query and we ended up forming a new line in front of the economy check in desk for premium passengers unnecessarily badly organised the staff in charge should be retrained security at the airport was very quick and through to the lounge this is a generic airport lounge for all airlines and it is actually quite good overall nice layout and seating options reasonable food and drink options and an outdoor terrace which is really nice boarding was very well organised although quite slow to get everyone on board but the flight was probably only half full and we still departed early so i think they felt no rush and it actually made the boarding experience nicer and more relaxed on board the club europe seats are fine by european business standards although as previously commented are really not very good overall the meal service was disappointing as is normal ba do not stock enough of the proper meal option  when the options are so limited and varied in quality ba really should stock enough for everyone to have the good meal sadly they had run out by the time they got to me so i had the option of vegetarian sausage or a salad i wanted a hot meal so went for the sausage and i can honestly say it was one of the most disgusting onboard meals ive ever had in any cabin class rolling some mush similar consistency to mashed potato into a sausage shape does not make it a sausage ba you need to improve the meal options make the vegetarian meal something you specifically have to request in advance and offer all passengers a choice of two decent meals  then people will not be left with such a substandard alternative when their first choice runs out whilst i hadnt planned on using it the on board wifi was not functioning so was not available to use overall though the flight was fairly comfortable and the cabin crew were very friendly and efficient i used avios to pay for the flight so it was obviously good value for money for me
not verified  all  of our flights were fine in terms of comfort punctuality and service i feel safe with ba and that is my main reason for booking with them even though i could travel with other airlines more directly on our return flight atllhr we skipped the evening meal preferring to sleep and were looking forward to a hearty breakfast prior to arrival at lhr sadly we were seriously disappointed to serve a chicken sausage in a wrap for a business class breakfast is just unacceptable does ba actually pay experts to design these breakfasts low point on an otherwise good trip
cnot verified   i had hoped this would be a good review but unfortunately it wont be i flew business class from lhr to pdx on the ba nonstop it was a  series aircraft the flight attendant specifically mentioned it was eight years old as he recalled flying it when it was brand new the business class seats were abysmal my seat was at the window facing backwards with the divider down which had to be in that position for boarding taxi takeoff and landing i was literally just a few feet away from the person in the aisle seat who was facing forward we both couldnt help but stare at one another it couldnt be avoided it was horrible the service wasnt all that good either the flight attendant did a predinner drink when she came back to ask for my choice for dinner she said none of my selection were left i was a little upset as nothing else appealed to me she then came back later and said the other part of the aircraft had more of the meal selection i wanted im not sure why they didnt coordinate that to begin with i was not offered any wine or other drink with with dinner the meal was put down in front of me and the flight attendant never came back other than to clear the tray overall this flight was not very good i flew over on american and back on ba and paid  roundtrip id fly american again my preferred carrier is united or lufthansa ill never fly ba again
 trip verified   i was going to fly to frankfurt from glasgow over london but the flight from london to frankfurt was cancelled this meant i had to stay overnight in london where i have no accommodation etc as i was rebooked to a flight from london city airport which was more than h by train i had to get an uber and then take a hotel for  in total london prices i was reassured over the phone that i would get all the money back my flight from london city airport was then cancelled again and rebooked to london heathrow but two days later i then cancelled that flight and rebooked a new one with lufthansa as i urgently had to get to work and needed the money i never received the money back for the hotel compensation for cancelled flight  compensation for cancelled flight  the extra food i had to pay for the uber or the actual cost of the flight i was first transferred  by british airways they stopped replying to me and told me the issue was weather conditions although other nonba flights were going i lost over  in total and never got compensated for the loss of a work day either it just really feels like they dont care about people worst serviceairline ever
 trip verified  much better experience this time around flew cpt to lhr on a new a checkin was efficient i used the bidvest lounge at cpt as it is better than bas lounge boarding was speedy the new business class club suites are very good slightly irritating to be directed to the wrong seat a instead of k which meant that after settling in the passenger in a showed up we arranged a seat switch second time in a row it has happened why cant ba staff memorise which side of the plane is which and get it right captains announcement was short and on point welcome drink was served at the correct temperature ie cold first time ever for me  previously ba has always served the welcome champagne warm ife system was good  everything worked as it should felt slightly cheap that business class passengers have to pay for wifi i did not bother cocktail was good the nuts came on a cheap plastic tray which was naff  other airlines bring out something classier a female flight attendant came to take my order and i asked for rooibas panacotta and the chicken breast she repeated back to me so you want a p and a c it was such a bizarre thing to say that i misheard i thought she said so you want beef and sea confusion reigned until she explained to me she had a checklist of passenger orders and they abbreviate to first letters so she was saying p for panacotta and c for chicken but how bizarre to repeat back an order to a passenger in code why not just say so to confirm panacotta to start and chicken as your main dish like every other restaurant  airline does in the world the internal coding of food ordering is exactly that  internal she even looked irritated at me that i did not understand her jargon first time the food when it came was excellent much much better than recent flights i read somewhere that ba changed caterer if so it shows the panacotta was superb as was the chicken  good restaurant quality the wine was ok to good but definitely not good to excellent i feel that while the food has got better in ba business class the wines have got worse certainly compared to air france which i have also flown recently the wine was brought out on time not afer i finished eating as it was lass time i flew ba business cheese was also good and not teeth crackingly cold as last time i had a good nights sleep plenty of snacks out if you wanted them and they did not run out breakfast was excellent and the coffee was hot previously it has been lukewarm so all in all a vastly improved service offering the staff seemed rushed off their feet  it would not hurt to have an extra flight attendant to look after so many business class seats overall summary vastly improved passenger proposition it would be  but i deduct a point for showing me to the wrong seat and another point for the bizarre interaction with the female flight attendant who repeated my food order back to me using internal jargon codes
 trip verified  once again a terrible business class experience with ba the flight was delayed by  hours the plane was very old with problems with at least  of the seats in business class not cleaned properly prior to departure food was terrible as always with ba and only one choice available from advertised menu as a result of the delay we missed our connecting flight from heathrow and instead of putting us on the next connection they chose the second last flight of the day  which was also delayed by over an hour meaning we had an additional  hour delay whilst at heathrow at no point were we advised about our compensation rights despite asking at check in and connections or provided any vouchers during the delays having flown etihad qatar and virgin business class equivalents over the last year it is clear to see how big the gulf now is between ba and its rivals 
 trip verified   ba as are showing their age hopefully they will update the interiors soon because it was a let down especially when the flight lasts  hours cabin crew were good and helpful dinner was ok but the breakfast was grim on board entertainment was not the latest and seat back usb points didnt work the only upside of ba is that it is only  of  airlines who fly this route directly and their pricing reflects this if youre prepared to lay over then there are better airlines out there
 trip verified    credit to ba  flew to singapore recently and also back from doha to london and both experiences were great service was fantastic as was the quality of the food entertainment and was left feeling ba have got it together after a few previous below average experiences you definitely notice the difference with the staff on ba  far more approachable and outgoing compared to the cold and corporate middle eastern airline crews nice one ba for  great flights
 trip verified    the check in area for premium classes at gatwick is very nice and there was no queue when i arrived so i was able to drop my bag very quickly premium security at gatwick is fine the flight was delayed due to nats issues but the member of staff on arriving at the lounge let me know of this the lounge is nicevand it very comfortable there was an excellent range of food and drinks all the drinks you would expect food wise there were sandwiches soup pasta salads fruit spanish stew as well as turkey and ham pies with mashed potato roasted parsnips and carrots and gravy it was all really good and particularly nice to see so many options boarding was pretty slow although the gate crew did a good job to keep it well organised and allow priority passengers to board first as has been well documented the onboard experience in terms of seat on ba europe business is pretty poor but in line with other european carriers sadly that being said the seat is well padded and comfortable and the adjustable headrest is quite good the on board catering was of excellent quality i was lucky to get my preferred option of the roast turkey but several people sat near me werent as lucky i do understand that meal options may run out but when the meal options are roast turkey with all the trimmings vegetarian cottage pie or a chicken salad you really should be stocking enough for every passenger to get the proper meal  or failing that allow an order in advance service where you then only stock the meals that people want to eat whilst i fully support the desire to minimise waste both food and cost people really should really be able to get the ideal meal option unfortunately one of the people affected reacted very badly to this and took it out on the cabin crew which is unacceptable they also lost a bit of perspective about just how serious a situation it actually was the cabin crew were  very nice friendly and professional if a little slow but not to the point of detracting from the positive experience i had the ground service at gran canaria was pretty poor priority bags clearly meant nothing  of bags coming out were not priority mine came out about halfway through bag delivery and demonstrates poor delivery of service and not  fulfilling on the service they promise to their customers overall though it was a very nice flight and having paid for it using avios and  i cannot complain at all
 trip verified   the flight took off a little late due to heathrow congestion but still landed on schedule boarding was smooth and the onboard service was efficient a small snack was served for free with a bottle of water additional items were available for purchase the cabin and toilets were very clean overall an unremarkable flight but in a good way
 trip verified  ba is great in the air but they sell you connections thru london heathrow terminal  their private baonly terminal which you are practically not able to make  minutes stopover time european flight inbound transatlantic flight outbound you arrive at the terminal gate on time and book security endless line slow process your boarding starts and you are nowhere near the x ray and then it is a train ride withing the same terminal but different distant buildings almost impossible to make lots of stress
 trip verified   i had broken my leg  days before our return flight from lisbon to london i called to get some assistance from british airways hoping for wheelchair assistance an easier seat to get to or possibly an upgrade so that i could stretch out my broken leg which was in a cast this airline failed on all fronts quoted us a price of  each i was traveling with my husband which we could not do almost didnt let me on the plane trying to interpret my medical report they did not attempt to change our seats which were near the back the single concession they made was to allow me to board st but did not offer a wheelchair so i had to swing myself down the aisle to my seat using the arm rests of all  rows before my seat as the aisles are not wide enough for crutches might i add i am nearly  had to exit same way no wheelchair waiting for me at heathrow had to hop onto bus with crutches to change terminals and nearly took a tumble doing so took so long to get a wheelchair that they had to hold my connecting flight on another airline for me and we were last to board that flight had allowed us to upgrade to business class for a reasonable price and took great care of me
 trip verified  check in at mia straightforward ba use american flagship lounge near gate d which is excellent flight delayed but only by  hours boarding chaotic on board staff were fine seat was fine too but product ageing post take off service prompt slept for  hours i noticed that in club world ba have ditched rose champagne which is a shame pre arrival breakfast was ok slow to deplane luggage off ok
 trip verified    never i saw such a terrible customer experience the plane landed already  minutes late despite any operational delays the boarding took over  hour because the crew did not know where to place the luggages after this long  hour boarding process the captain did not apologise  this is extremely frustrating when this occurs on a night flight forcing passengers to lose train connections to home
 trip verified   having not flown with ba for a few years i read some of the reviews in preparation needless to say i boarded this flight with low expectations i was pleasantly surprised as the flight was ok we left lhr a few minutes early and arrived at jnb ahead of schedule cabin crew although not as good as some carriers were attentive and professional onboard catering was a disappointment as if you were unlucky to miss out on the chicken you were given a very sloppy pasta on board entertainment has never been bas strong point and sadly that hasnt changed unfortunately ba is not the prestigious carrier it once was but its not as bad from my experience as some reviews suggest
 trip verified  dear community i feel compelled to share the utter frustration and disappointment that defined my recent travel experience with british airways buckle up folks this ones a rollercoaster on july  and   i had the displeasure of flying with british airways on ba and ba and let me tell you it was a nightmare the initial flight from zurich zrh to london lhr on ba faced a seemingly unavoidable onehour delay upon arrival at lhr this of course resulted in me missing my connection to tokyo triggering an automatic rescheduling of my flight to tokyo hnd via beijing with air china oh but the fun didnt stop there  flight ca was also delayed turning my hour delay into a grand total of  hours finally arriving in tokyo at  instead of the promised  and the cherry on top my four checkedin suitcases decided to take a detour and didnt join me in tokyo forcing me to waste an additional two hours filling out forms at the baggage center i finally got my lost luggage back on july  because why make it easy right but wait theres more my return flight from tokyo to zurich ba on august  also danced to the delay tune making me question if punctuality is just a myth for british airways the cumulative impact of these delays torpedoed my vacation plans stealing a whole day of scheduled activities including a guided tokyo tour as if that werent enough i had to dig deeper into my pockets for unforeseen expensesextra airport transfers tour operator assistance fees emergency purchases airport meals and international calls for rearrangements the lack of assistance at lhr airport was the icing on this bitter cake installing the ba app just to get basic information about alternative connection flights was a hassle and the fact that no ba clerk could provide this info in person was downright infuriating british airways youve left me with a sour taste in my mouth and a dent in my wallet heres hoping you take this feedback seriously and step up your game because right now its not a good look frustrated and fed up bert
 trip verified   quick bag drop at first wing but too many passengers so had to use fast track security in main terminal direct entry to concorde room outside security south ate excellent breakfast which was served promptly concorde room is a nice place to wait for a flight there is some interesting memorabilia and an excellent bar boarding from c gates was disorganised and slow on board cabin crew excellent good choice of beverages and these were of high quality food was good seat comfortable no first bedding provided on time arrival into miami baggage took  hour to arrive
 trip verified    hours before takeoff we received a mail stating a cryptic message that there are disruptions to be expected as there is a limit on how many planes can leave at the same time so did the capacity of the heathrow airport really hit british airways by surprise h before departure anyhow  we took the one hour delay so what  but then we have been forced to check in our hand luggage i travel only with hand luggage to avoid waiting for the ultra slow processing of the checked in luggage overall h later at home than planed with really no reason just due to incompetent people service level far worse then ryanair and triple the price really never again thanks for nothing
 trip verified   i recently had a delay on british airways from bru to lhr that was due to staff shortages they announced that there was a  hour holding delay but they would board us immediately in hopes of clearing the gate and leaving early we had to wait the full  hours inside the airplane the plane was old dirty had no power at the seats the staff provided a small bag of pretzels and ml of water to the passengers for  hour delay and  hour flight there were no options to purchase food or drink there were no entertainment options available i am a oneworld emerald elite member but they do not upgrade members based on status first class lounges at heathrow are overcrowded understaffed and poorly equipped the help desk is completely unhelpful when an error arises with delays and cancellations  even when having the top status the avios points system has been devalued to near worthlessness and requires fees to book reward that nearly equal the price of the revenue ticket british has lost its way in recent years and has a moved from a worldclass airline to a budget airline with much worse service and timeliness than ryanair or easyjet
not verified   boarded on time but it took ages to get to the runway due to congestion flight was smooth and quick snack and drinks were good for a short flight landed only about ten minutes late one bag of three left in london forms quickly filled in and the bag was delivered the next morning
 trip verified    days before the flight we were advised by ba that it had been cancelled and asked us to rebook there were flights  hour before and  hour after our original flight but they made us take one  hours earlier our original ticket and the return flight a week later included a checked bag when we arrive at heathrow to check in we are told our ticket doesnt included a bag and we will have to pay  pounds each to take them we explained that the original ticket had the bags and when they checked the system they confirmed that it did but not this one they would make no effort to sort it out and just told us to pay up or they would remove us from the flight so we had no choice but to pay up thinking it should be pretty easy to get a refund  months and  emails later we have still not seen a penny every time i ask where my refund is and state how long we have been waiting i get an inane email saying some departments take longer than others to respond  absolutely hopeless airline to stuff up the booking in the first place and even worse customer service to not even attempt to solve the problem at check in even when they could see the mistake they had made in their system compounded by being be unable to investigate a very simple claim and refund me  pounds in  months
"not verified   
we traveled to lisbon for our dream vacation a cruise to portugal and spain our friends did not ever get their luggage it was a two week cruise two weeks without a change of clothes or her cpap machine contacting customer service was a nightmare we never talked to a real person very little effort was put into getting them their bags in one port we were on the ship and the bags were at the airport the airlines did not deliver the bags nor did they tell our friends that they needed to go get them the airline couldnt be bothered to take the bags from the airport to the ship ba says it is their policy to get you your bags within  hours that is a joke its been over two weeks and they still dont have them they are back home in the us and last they heard the bags were in lisbon if your have a choice do not fly british airways customer service is non existent"
 trip verified   booked a flight from bucharest to manchester with a h  layover at heathrow flight was delayed from bucharest because of atc strike arrived at heathrow  minutes later than scheduled and still had enough time to catch my connecting flight unfortunately we were stranded in the plane and waited a very long time to disembark the plane due to lack of staff or slot shortage its a common problem with ba at heathrow i missed my connecting flight because of their delays and they told me i had to wait all night in a freezing airport for the first flight the next day there was just a shameful  food voucher which is a joke considering the ridiculous prices at lhr no accommodation offered and had to sleep in a very cold airport i asked for compensation and they sent me a long text with the same lame excuses that they are sorry but they will not compensate anything  i cant imagine a worst airline than ba regarding customer care it is not about money here but rather than the way they treat customers it is the last time in my lifetime that i will be flying this joke of an airline
 trip verified   booked online months ago and the only hitch was replacement aircraft meaning chosen seats were different i was informed of this prior to departure so could amend bag drop at man t wasnt smooth but i suspect that was man fault shuttle boarding was slow and delayed meaning a rush at lhr t the flight to cpt was full but we left more or less on time the cabin was clean and pe was what we expected sufficient leg and arm room plus a few little perks with drinks only complaint is the seats actually recline too far staff were very good during the first few hours of service especially george food was quite tasty but one option wasnt loaded breakfast was also quite tasty and we landed on time the fly in the ointment is both our cases arrived late on the carousel and only later did we notice both had been broken into likely at cpt all in all a pleasant surprise
 trip verified   the flight was on time the crew were polite it was the same story on my outward flight i find that ba in europe is generally pretty good though i regret that they have substituted prosecco for champagne on the list of drinks you can buy in economy so many complaints about ba and other airlines revolve around lost luggage that i never check in bags even for long trips
not verified   angry disappointed and unsatisfied my route was from london to atlanta my suitcase was not boarded therefore not landed with me for both comfort and safety reason a bag always fly with its passenger and that did not happen claims and few phone calls were made by desk assistants who answered my questions unprofessionally and miserably certainly i was left with nothing but my backpack which contained not more than few snacks neither clothes nor anything else was ever provided as an apology meanwhile i was also told that my bag would have been delivered through the next  hours which also did not happen british airways is a great airline to fly with but its organization when it comes to customer service is poor and uncertain still waiting for my bag
 trip verified   as an infrequent flyer british airways was always my first choice with some reassurance and comfort of service quality luggage allowance etc in fact ive never flown with the budget airlines my most recent flight has now changed my view and causes me to reflect on what am i actually getting for my money and is ba what they once were while the flights were around an hour delayed both ways the cabin and ground staff service were ok it is the facilities or lack of that i am most disappointed by the flight was approx  and a half hours and the only thing offered was a half cup of water that was poured out and a bite sized banana slice of cake in fact on my return journey i wasnt even offered the water to top it off ba no longer have a media screen from which you can select something to pass the time away there wasnt even the obligatory flight journey the wifi was poor i couldnt even access the shop however for a fee so much more was available this explains bas record profit of bn so the question is what am i paying for i will now for sure opt for the budget airlines they are transparent with what they offer and what you have to pay for which i can decide to choose or not as ba now stands for basic airways ill go elsewhere and get basic for cheaper
not verified   a totally unremarkable flight on time as comfortable as european configuration goes no catering due to the storm  effect greatly exaggerated this was advised by email and a euro  was provided  not easy to use  but lounge made up for this loss
 trip verified     ground crew in heathrow left  passengers luggage we had  bags  the heathrow ground crew left  of ours behind after the st two were received the next day  the heathrow ground crew lost our rd bag  times and we were on the phone with them for over  hrs over the course of the week  due to this we had to spend  on health and beauty items for my wife on our cruise  british airways said they might reimburse after  months  we had to spend  in cab fare to barcelona because the bacelona ground crew iberia claimed they had delivered it to us  heathrow ground crew made us  minutes late arriving back into heathrow after our cruise we actually landed  minutes early but those incompetent people still were not ready for us  the heathrow ground crew caused us to leave  minutes late even though all passengers were boarded and ready  minutes before the departure time this will probably mean we will miss our connection in anchorage ba clearly does not care or know how to operate a ground baseshameful ba is a joke and should be embarrassed they cant operate like a normal airline they do not grasp the concept that even a small hiccup can cause mass ripples of chaos to other people
 trip verified   london heathrow to gibraltar on th october  i shall start by reference to the booking process i used the ba website to reserve the seat and food the website to be easy to use and clear in every aspect the flight was due to depart from terminal  but the passengers were bussed for a good  minutes to a different part of the airport where the aircraft was on a stand when boarding the flight the cabincrew kept a very low profile and this was maintained during the entire flight the captain made  brief announcements during the flight there was no inflight entertainment the seats were clean and comfortable enough for a short flight the lack of catering was overt other than a tiny bottle of water and an inedible breakfast bar one had to use an online system to order even a drink and of course pay for it too the passengers next to me could not use the online system as it doe not seem to work and the cabin refused to sell them a coffee because of this fault moreover the usb charge points did not work either given the early hour of the flight it is a poor show that there are not even for sale items available from a trolley service the system ba have in place is not good enough the flight arrived ontime the disembarkation was inefficient though and poorly managed and the crew were not to be seen the crew were wearing the new ba uniform and it seems to reflect a downward trend of the airline to be candid there was any difference between this ba service and that of socalled budget rivals on this route ba have a monopoly and so i did not have an option to use the services of a different company
 trip verified  first time flying british airways and i would not hesitate to fly economy with them again flight attendants were pleasant and efficient excellent special meal low sodium comfortable space in economy one of my better flights
not verified   i flew london to cairo and return in october  it was basically a perfectly good pair of flights in economy with pleasant and professional cabin crew especially on the return journey being only  m tall i have no problem with legroom in the back of the plane the seat was ok if getting a little numbing after  hours and the return of a rather good included snack box and drinks was welcome however it must be said that the value for money was poor with a checked bag on the return leg only this was a nearly  ticket and although i am content to pass the time by reading or sleeping it was surprising to find no inflight entertainment on hour flights however overall i would still recommend ba and would do so even more enthusiastically if it was more sensibly priced
not verified   absolutely the worst experience ever  flew into heathrow no problem waited for  hours three extra hours for our connection to porto then the cancelled the flight scrambled for a hotel and a new flight the next day they routed us through madrid the next morning that flight was  hours late so we missed our connection to porto because we missed the connection their fault they cancelled our return flights after two hours on the phone with customer service from the madrid airport they booked us a new return flight then they made is pay   to fly from madrid to porto then for no reason they cancelled our return flight again after hours and hours and hours with customer service we finally got a return flight five days after our original return flight meanwhile they lost my wifes luggage we finally got  days after they lost it return flight more problems with our reservations at no point was british airways helpful they left the onus on us to fix their mistakes at every turn they completely ruined a three week vacation and they dont care they wouldnt even let us speak to a supervisor or manager awful bordering on passenger abuse
not verified    flew back from malta after scattering our sons ashes at his favourite spots when we boarded the aircraft for our return flight my wife became upset a member of the cabin crew noticed this and immediately spoke to my wife and tried to reassure her her name is tracey an exceptional crew member i noticed she spoke to other travellers in a courteous manner and was friendly each time she passed my wife she asked how she was and would she like anything this kindness made a difficult time easier for us both aircraft seats were comfortable and service good for a hrs mins flight thank you ba
not verified  cabin luggage had to go to cargo even when i said i carried medicines there was no time to get them out the hand luggage the economy seats with virgin atlantic klm and even ryanair have more space luckily it was a short flight
 trip verified   i have been using ba for a while now and on average i cannot say that i am pretty satisfied ba somehow experience cancellations and delays most of the time second the inflight service is usually weak food portions are small and cabin crew is not very helpful especially when it comes to drink requests the screens in the as should be renewed as they are full of scratches and same size as as especially in longer flights the entertainment system becomes more important there is also no welcome package except for pillow and small blanket i would expect more from ba if you are flying from the us to anywhere except the uk i would recommend considering other airlines but if you are flying tofrom uk directly then ba could be one of your choices
 trip verified    i flew from istanbul to london in business class for more than half of the flight a child was watching an ipad very loud with no phones plugged in  it was three rows in front of me and disrupted my flight as i could hear it above my headphones staff thought this was fine and refused to tell the mom to turn it down why is this acceptable on a flight especially in business class has this airline turned into a zoo are staff given no training in customer service why is a child allowed to disrupt other passengers when i told the staff she just laughed at me ba customer service is a disgrace ive not even mentioned the food but it was bad really bad
not verified   i have flow on ba several times since the airline started nonstop service between austin tx and london heathrow every year the service gets worse i brought a tape measure with me to see how far apart the seats are in the economy section  inches ba has removed bathrooms in order to squeeze a few more rows of seats onto the aircraft thankfully im not a big person and was able to squeeze into my seat without being too uncomfortable when ba first started flying out of austin the food was great now when i arrive at heathrow i get real food and take it on the plane with me i dont know where or who makes bas food but it is not eatable if ba did not have a direct flight from my hometown to london i would fly with a different airline when we checked into heathrow the line was extremely long and only one person was checking people in it took nearly an hour to get to the counter i understand airlines are making record profits and need to make up lost revenue from the pandemic but i think ba has gone too far and has little concern for customer service in pursuit of profits
 trip verified    the flight departed over an hour late due to a late inbound plane the plane was very full and half of the economy class passengers were forced to check in their larger cabin baggage at the gate when boarding making a complete mockery of the hand luggage allowance advertised lots of passengers on board were stressed out about missing onwards connections due to the delays and some did miss them as their next gates had closed by the time we disembarked at heathrow onboard service was ok but minimal   ba gave up being a fullservice airline some time ago more concerning is that trying to get hold of customers services to make changes to bookings and deal with problems was nonexistent the airline seems to make it deliberately hard for its customers to contact it
 trip verified    i hate british airways we get to london on oct  and our next flight is cancelled we stand in line with  other people to get it fixed and they tell everyone to leave the airport and call them to fix they book us the next dayvia online dont offer vouchers for hotel we will miss our tour now trying to get home from istanbul plane is here but should have started loading an hour ago no explanations may miss next flight will never travel with them again was this same problem april  flight
 trip verified    our ba flight from porto to london heathrow t was operated by finnair using a finnair plane and crew this had been advised by ba shortly after booking with the option to change flights if we preferred although the business class cabin was of a similar layout to ba club europe ie with the middle seat kept free my wife and i felt the seats were more comfortable and the legroom slightly better service was good on board and the meal was very tasty we chose the beef cheeks all was good until we landed at heathrow although we passed through passport control without delay once we were at the designated baggage reclaim we just waited and waited after an hour and ten minutes i went to the ba baggage counter to ask what was going on they seemed unaware of an issue but said they would find out over the next hour or so various other passengers also requested information and despite various announcements and a list of different excuses it was almost  hours before the bags finally arrived frustrating to say the least i subsequently complained to ba but after  weeks there has been no explanation just the automated message from customer services we are experiencing exceptionally high volumes this response says a lot
 trip verified  the customer services call centres etc are atrocious and sometimes callous they just dont care long waits to speak to anybody who then have no power to actually solve anything and the calls just cut halfway without resolution anyway if the flights are cancelled as were my original ones youre really left on your own and nobody cares the onboard services are soso but for short haul its now semilow cost which is confusing as you never know what to expect this time we were given a bottle of water and a very small snack whilst anything else had to be paid for and yet on some other flights apparently you have to preorder any additional food its confusing which makes it not dependable cabin baggage is in theory generous compared to competitors in economy but then they asked more than half the passengers on this flight to check in the cabin baggage at the gate due to lack of space in the overhead cabins leading to long boarding delays their whole offering hasnt been thought through very well  the usb power supply did not work throughout the flight contrary to the announcement that the power be available after the seatbelt sight was turned off  so it was pointless providing the sockets in the first place not my first choice airline on this route and am just trying to use up most of my avios points before i totally abandon them i fail to see how it is deemed a  star airline
 trip verified    i am a frequent flyer with ba and have been for the last  years having noted the ratings given frankly i cannot understand how ba scores three stars for most aspects of its service in a nutshell ba has placed profit margins over passenger appreciation this fact was hammered home on my return leg which was not in club europe quite alarmingly ba appears to place profit over passenger safety by extending its business class seating up to and beyond emergency exit rows and then failing to ensure those seated in exit rows have the physical capacity to actually open the door incase of an emergency i was not at all reassured to see an elderly and slightly built woman seated with the responsibility of opening the overwing exit should the need have arisen shorthaul business club europe is simply a joke and only useful for gaining valuable tier points for loungepreboarding benefits while cabin crew service is excellent the lack of space and reduction in refreshment choices etc places them a million airmiles behind competing airlines such as qatar turkish or emirates who understand the true definition of customer appreciation and hospitality ba has consistently eroded the value of their executive club and seems to be of the impression that recent changes in obtaining avios points during the booking process benefit passengers  really i want to support ba and did enjoy flying with them up to the point when they started penny pinching and became more deserving of the name budget airways the attached photos taking during my most recent itinerary highlight the difference in customer careappreciation between british airways and another airline used in this trip both flights were around  hours in duration on the same day guess which one is shows bas inflight offering
not verified   flew with ba to punta cana took the trouble to reserve seats for both outbound and inbound flights on boarding at gatwick realised we had been moved to much less good seats with other people sitting in the seats we had spent a lot of money reserving apparently there has been a change of aircraft and a number of passengers had been automatically reallocated seats for no particular reason the crew said there was nothing they could do although of course they could just have swapped us with the couple using our seats we were told to claim a refund on return home we did this via a complaint form ns ba offered us  in vouchers we didnt accept this as it was less than the cost of the seats and also naturally we wanted our money back we eventually got it but not without a fight very second rate shoddy airline
 trip verified    they downgraded me from business to premium economy they took three months to get back to me and offered me  pounds or  aud the difference between business class and premium economy which i never fly is  aud and the difference between economy and business is  aud they owe me at least  pounds and to be very fair  pounds the downgrade was insulting and incredibly painful as i had a recent cancer operation and have a back injury which i have pointed out to them  i need to lie down the wait for them to get around to me has been numbing the insult of their offer has been the slap in the face to continue my degradation the people i have dealt with at the airport have been down to earth honest hard working people the actual staff on the plane were warm and friendly  and helpful the systems under which ba operates are some sort of medieval torture
 trip verified    the already delayed aircraft landed and apart from the small ba logo on the rear of the fuselage there was no indication as to whom the carrier really was boarding turned into a farce with passenger groups being told to wait in one queue in order to board only to be informed we were on the wrong place and our boarding wasnt allowed yet the interior cabin was reminiscent of a ba cabin from twenty years earlier except the tight legroom and uncomfortable seating which made a budget airline feel luxurious the crew were not ba but from an unknown charter company service was slow and as usual choices of food to purchase ran out before theyd reached row  i requested a cup of tea which never appeared thank goodness for my airport purchased water and the tiny offering of pretzels the over officious senior flight attendant whod been facilitating in club europe appeared in economy and immediately slammed down the armrests whilst still in mid flight making an already uncomfortable journey feel worse cattle class was definitely that to say i was happy to land and disembark was an understatement never again ba never again
 trip verified    caught up in the gatwick cancellation fiasco at some point between what was smooth check in unable to do online as part of group travel and security the flight was cancelled we were denied entry to security and departures as a result it was at this point that we discovered ba gatwick are not ba but a masquerade who are unable to help and and provide very little assistance unless the real ba provide information and even though our baggage was now airside didnt have a clue as to how we could get it back it is however with thanks to a supervisor from business class check in who came to our assistance and help with our predicament baggage retrieval information on what to claim and how and our revised ba flight from lhr the following evening difficult to give a rating for cabin service as we didnt even board the aircraft
 trip verified    ba has a real problem with boarding its flights those who get on first fill the luggage bins with  bags one of which is supposed to be small and under seat only cabin staff dont bother implementing their own rules subsequent passengers mill up and down the aisle bumping into each other searching for space boarding this flight took an hour as a result of this nonsense the incoming flight was late already so our  minute flight was  minutes late
 trip verified  our connecting flight from london to glasgow was canceled and we were forced to wait  hours in the airport for a new flight when we received our luggage at glasgow we discovered that our luggage was soaking wet my wifes luggage contents were wet and had to be air dried
 trip verified    the worst airline i have ever flown with allocated the very back row next to the toilets and galley no chance of getting any sleep question asked of possible seat movement ignored and getting bumped the entire time by cabin crew walking or pushing kart up and down aisle without one apology would have been better sitting in the luggage compartment
 trip verified    excellent service levels proactive crew and superb food and beverages i found all aspects of the service to be superior to ba business class even the new ba club suites first class felt exclusive the dedicated crew were clearly used to working the premium cabin enjoying their work were proactive friendly very respectful and the food and beverage offering a considerable step up from business class the seat with sliding double doors was spacious well designed and very comfortable  british airways offered a solid first class service from concorde lounge to boarding which was actually by group number for a change to the very warm and genuine welcome on boarding a consistent solid comfortable service from start to finish and if the price was right i would not hesitate to book first class with british airways again
not verified   booked a very special holiday for me and my partner september arrived and we were on our way to lovely south of france booked business class for us both to start the holiday right as we were checking i was told the flight was over booked and our seats wouldnt print onto the ticket for some reason we had already made sure the seats were booked when we had booked the flights nearly a year prior to going unfortunately when we arrived at the gate we were then told we would no longer be sat together and one of us would in fact have to go into economy my girlfriend is an extremely nervous flyer and so had to take extra tablets to remain calm she didnt have any food which we had pre booked also and she was sat right down the bottom end of the flight we were held at the gate with another  or  couples all in the same predicament all due to the lovely money grabbing british airways over booking the flight they ended up refusing passengers in the end and even had people sat on the fold down chairs in the toilet area when we eventually arrived in france late we was waiting for our luggage to come our airtags stated that both our cases was in fact still in heathrow we then had to wait  days for them to eventually come into france by this point our holiday was ruined british airways was absolutely shocking we couldnt speak to anyone as all the phone numbers were no longer in use we felt stranded in a foreign country with no clothes and no one to help use with what to do next every day we watched them case not moved as we were tracking with air tags it was so frustrating not being able to plan our days in hope we would get the call to then drive all the way back to the air port  hours each way to collect our cases we ended up going out and buying new clothes toiletries and all the stuff to make the best of our ruined holiday saving all the receipts thinking we would be able to claim it all back how wrong i was british airways take zero responsibility and fob me off with going through my insurance british airways only pay for basic essentials pants and toothpaste i filed a complaint when i got back and requested my money back for business class and they havent even had the decency to even respond they are an absolute joke of a company and i wish they would remove british out of there name because there is nothing british about them do not give them your money they cant even look after their staff let alone customers oh and dont bother trying to cancel your flight either as they just take all of your money off you and give you nothing back
not verified  just returned from chicago flew out  days ago on american airlines absolutely superb in every way had high expectations on return flight with ba what a disappointment the airbus a may be nice from a pilots perspective but as a passenger it was awful very uncomfortable seats the inflight entertainment and flight tracker failed to work throughout the flight the inflight meal was inedible and the service was mediocre at best our short flight from heathrow to manchester was much improved very welcoming and attentive in flight staff and the flight even arrived early in future we will travel with one of the american carriers 
 trip verified   ba standards continue to decline every time i fly with them this time a  min late departure which seems the norm for ba and no information from the rude and clueless boarding gate staff the club lounge was overcrowded dirty and grubby and cleaning staff could not cope how many more cutbacks is ba going to apply before they become truly low cost as a  year veteran user of ba while people complained of alex cruz cutting costs the past  years has seen them decline very quickly under their latest ceo one reads the occasional article about ba improving things but i have yet to see anything substantive there seem to be few british staff left amongst the cabin crew so maybe time for a name change and give the flag carrier status to a proper lowcost  and sadly the staff service has declined year on year onboard the catering remains poor and surprised that doco can produce such rubbish meals when i have sampled their turkish airlines equivalent in august that was superb  guessing ba are too tight with their budget onboard wifi service is a joke and should be avoided
not verified   awful business class check in queue just as long as for economy probably because half of the desks were not staffed and terminal  is chaotic business lounge overfull couldnt get seats delayed flight unmanaged chaos at the gate no drink on boarding first drink served an hour after takeoff the meal was poor used to get better in economy on other airlines british airways has won the race to the bottom of the cheapskate stakes not looking forward to the flight home
 trip verified   not a reliable airline you cannot trust the timing at all i had a am flight boarding was on time but then we are sitting in the plane for already  hours and the expected departure is still not clear they have discovered the engine is not working i am risking to be late for a business meeting in geneva how come they bring a not working plane to the gate the funny thing is that i had another business trip in spring  also with ba to amsterdam when i arrived to the airport that time  i was told i dont have a seat i was put on the next flight in several hours which should have get me to the business meeting late but still not too much a lot of stress in the end on the second plane we were sitting in the cabin for  hours and i have missed the meeting i thought it was a dramatic unlucky case that time but today i see its routine for ba not to fly on time
 trip verified   i take comfort in reading the last ten or so reviews to see im not the only traveller to put in words how absolutely abysmal british airways are the only reason we are stuck using this awful airline is to use up points we booked club europe months ago london to athens sat in row  and told they had run out of food options only choice was lentil pie or green curry returning athens to london club europe couldnt check in online as promised so arrived at the airport hrs early to be told they had overbooked the flight and basically we were being bumped to economy this airline fails to deliver time and time again it is a national disgrace and i implore everyone to choose an alternative 
 trip verified   the worst journey in my life the connection time at lhr was only  hour but the flight from mxp was on delay i had to rush to change terminal by train and arrived risking a heart attack after that the plane just stayed there for another  minutes despite that upon arrival at sjc my baggage was lost i filled the form and gave to the employee i was not given any receipt so i did not have any reference number ba phone number at sjc simply never answer i called twice the toll free number and realized they did not record the delivery address i had to enter myself online dealing with a shitty website they delivered the baggage three days later i claimed for compensation online as i had to buy clothes and other stuff and i did never get a receipt i was expecting an upgrade for the flight back to mxp but nothing happened neither they allowed me to enter ba lounge at sjc bad customer service the only positive side was price but obviously this cannot justify this treatment and if i knew  i would never flown by ba never again
 trip verified  the airplanes and the lounges are worn out old and broken from dallas to heathrow multiple first class seating and electronics were non functional and poorly designed the first class seating from heathrow to dubrovnik was nothing more than a tray blocking the middle seat of a standard coach ticket very disappointed
 trip verified  one of the worst experiences on the worst airline the flight was delayed due to earlier technical issues the time slipped from  to  to  and finally cancelled there was zero information given despite paying well over the odds for business class we were booted out of the ba lounge two hours before the flight when it was finally cancelled the ba staff without explanation told everyone to go to a gate after another hour or so they made us re enter the uk via passport control a further  minute wait by now the airport was closing and there was no sign of our bags or any help from ba a passing gatwick engineer finally helped us locate the bags ba completely washed their hands of us and in contravention of caa rules refused to find us accommodation many slept in a bus stop overnight there were people with young children who couldnt find somewhere to stay and yet ba had closed down and left the following day the replacement flight was also late and due to an admin mistake had no catering or liquids for a   hr flight overall the service was shockingly bad the worst i have experienced from any airline i will not ever use them again
 trip verified   cancelled our flight lastminute then moved us onto a flight  days later operated by japan airlines we had paid a lot extra for extra legroom seats as i am very tall and they assigned me a middle seat deep in the middle of the plane because it was operated by a different airline but booked by ba neither ba nor the other airline could change my seat over the phone despite seats being available after  hours of waiting in queues and sitting on hold their solution was for me to arrive early at the airport i did but the seats had already been given away for free by people who had booked directly with that airline and could check in online i got a  meal voucher as compensation for this enormous downgrade on a  hour flight never again will i fly ba i would rather fly indirect with better airlines than use this disgrace of an airline again
 trip verified  i had a flight from miami florida to dublin ireland via londons heathrow airport the outbound flight from miami was delayed and we were further delayed when our gate was occupied when we arrived in heathrow the total delay was roughly an hour but it was enough to make our connection a challenge where we had  minutes between original arrival time until the departure time to dublin when we headed to our connection flight we were stopped by security personnel at a checkpoint and told us that the gate to our connection flight had already closed this was twenty minutes prior to departure time they ushered us to customer service to be rebooked given the busy weekend of travel we were rebooked on a flight at a different airport and were told that our cost to get there would be reimbursed we then waited  hours for our luggage and then took a cab to londons city airport the cab fare was roughly  when i filed a claim with british airways they refused the claim and told me that we had plenty of time to make our connecting flight and therefore they denied my claim to be reimbursed for the cab fare this is after i explained that it was british airways employees who ushered us to rebook the flight despite the  minute timeframe to make the connecting flight the person who rebooked us told us it was policy that they close the gate  minutes prior to departure i will never fly this awful airline again given the other feedback on this site it appears that that is the overwhelming sentiment
 trip verified   we started our day with ba in prague the flight actually left on time i came to find out thats very unusual we purchased business class seats as you can see from the picture they hardly were business class all they did was block off the middle seat in the first few rows and called it business class horrible flight in addition i had a really rude rude check in clerk basically yell at me when i excused myself and asked if she could give a little bit of priority to the many business class passengers who werent being served then we got to heathrow and the real fun began we had a  hour delay they gave us about  different excuses for the delay i had a few employees walk away while i was asking them questions they were very rude at one point there were no employees left and from the announcements it seems virtually every ba flight was delayed and there were no weather issues there was no place to comfortably store items in business class ive never experienced that before not even a cup holder for my bottle of water the seat controls didnt work well you had to keep pushing the buttons to get them to do anything the power outlet didnt work there was no internet the entire flight the overhead luggage bin was too heavy i almost got a hernia having to close it this is a horrible airline ill never fly with them again if i could give zero stars i would
 trip verified   i fly british airways weekly not because i want to but because they own the route theres no other option therefore they frankly dont have to care about the customer the flights are always delayed and its always someone elses fault be it weather delays to incoming aircraft or flight traffic control issues ive heard it all and for the life of me cannot understand why they are allowed to operate ive been around the world and traveled with all of the worlds airlines but british airways are really the worst of the worst its such a shame to have watched what used to be a good company fall down a cliff my advice is if you have an option to fly with anyone else then exercise the option but if youre flying with different connections and you have a tight schedule do not expect ba to get you to your destination in time
not verified   everything was ok until our connecting flight in london just before take off we were on the runway the pilot came on to announce an engine problem after engineers tried to fix it while we waited on the plane for over an hour we were finally told that we would have to be evacuated and rebooked for another flight but not to worry because a special crew was waiting for us on the ground to help us and set us up in a hotel except that there was no one to help us in fact everyone refused to help us it was saturday almost pm and they just wanted to go home anyone with a connecting flight couldnt rebook on the application because the app wouldnt disassociate our first flight with the connecting one in london and the staff saw this but still refused to help us they gave us a phone number but there was only a message that said just to use the app finally i got someone on the phone who rebooked us for the next day now its pm and i have to find a hotel room because the airline refused also to help us with that so i had  choices either sleep in the airport or pay over gbp for a room i dont have the money to pay for this but after a  hour flight  hours of jet lag and the insane stress after the fact that no one from british airways would help us i took the room of course i claimed reimbursement but that was over  weeks ago and i havent heard anything since so i have no idea when or how much ill be reimbursed even though im not claiming any emotional compensation from the horrible situation they put me through due to their total indifference its financially difficult for me right now because the money i had to put out is equal to half my salary and of course its impossible to reach them by phone i feel still as i did on august   completely trapped by them and their indifference with no solution or information
not verified   my initial flight was cancelled  hours prior the flight then i was automatically rescheduled for next day next day the flight was delayed leaving hamburg and missed my connecting flight to las vegas me and several other passengers spent the night in london british airways provided us with vouchers but the transfer bus dropped us at the wrong hotel closest to our hotel and told us that we can walk there if we want to as a result i lost two nights hotel reservations that i made in las vegas i opened a claim and provided all receipts to british airways to get refund of my hotel reservations but over  weeks now not a single feedback from british airways i will avoid all flights with them in future and will share this story
not verified   we will never fly british airways again our flight on july   from lhr to lax was cancelled  hours before departure without any explanation since  weeks we are now waiting for the refund and ba does not pay us the cost caused by the cancellation very disappointing
 trip verified  check in and security clearance very quick at lhr t my wife and i used the galleries north lounge and at am it was easy to get a seat good buffet breakfast options flight boarded on time and flight departed on time i was seated in  a the club europe seats on the a seem to be getting smaller and legroom i am ft was very tight cabin crew service was fine i chose the full english breakfast it was ok but there was a lot of water in the bottom of the bowl flight landed on time overall an ok flight but club europe doesnt feel very premium these days
not verified   british airways has confirmed itself as the worst airline in the uk last minute cancellation no explanation refusal to book with another airline because we dont have an arrangement with them whats happened to what used to be our national airline
 trip verified  worst ba experience i was supposed to fly out to italy on  september  i arrived at or tambo international airport ready to check my bags in i already checkedin online the previous evening so i had my boarding pass ready at the counter i was told that i had been offloaded from the flight as my connecting flight has been cancelled no information was sent regarding this beforehand the team at the checkin counter tried to get me on another flight that evening but there were no flights available they did manage to get me another flight the following evening with lufthansa to italy via frankfurt however i did miss the first part of my trip having arrived a day and a half later than i was supposed to upon moving the flights i did ask the ba staff whether my flights back are still valid and that everything is in order which they assured me is correct i have to fly back to south africa on  september and upon checking my booking information i noticed on my ba account that my first flight milan to london is just missing from my booking my connecting from london to johannesburg is still there after spending the entire morning on the customer helpline two different operators picked up and in both instances the moment i proceed to give my booking reference number my call gets dropped currently it seems like i will be arriving at the airport again on monday without a flight
 trip verified   my daughter and i were denied boarding on our business class flight from madrid to heathrow in march   the first leg on our return flight to victoria canada no reason was given for the denied boarding by the check in staff at the british airways counter in madrid who said they were only agents and told us to call british airways we were three hours early for the flight and had valid passports after many tries we finally reached british airways by phone but we were told to call expedia which had booked the flights expedia confirmed that we had been bumped from the flight with no explanation as to why expedia then began a long process of finding alternative flights over the next  hours we had numerous calls with both expedia and british airways incredibly the next available flights were  days later on april  this was almost unbelievable but after many many tries it was the best we could do even though these were business class tickets part of the problem was that apparently rules did not allow any changes to routing for any segment of the flight this nine day delay was a major problem for us i had to miss work and my daughter was missing school further we received no compensation from british airways no penalty fee and not any reimbursement of our expenses for staying the nine extra days after our return i began the british airways online complaint process and submitted all supporting documents i received an email reply and a case reference number and then nothing i sent numerous follow up emails and received no replies it is now months later and still i have not heard from british airways this is shocking and definitely the worst airline service i have received for my thousands of flights over many decades i am a very patient person and this is the first time i have commented on this type of forum i think the public should be made aware of extremely poor customer service at british airways
 trip verified  despite boarding being the usual free for all at lhr with groups  being called to board all at once whilst those passengers who had agreed to check in a bag in at the gate getting to board before anyone else however the service on board was impeccable superb crew friendly attentive interacting with passengers and generally appearing to be enjoying their job like ba in the old days and at its best food choice and quality seems to have improved too no beef cheeks thankfully and even the club kitchen appears to have returned old style club seating but is at least better and feels less cramped on the s
not verified   flight cancelled no crew th september  not peak holiday period so why such bad management by ba sent to the gate left standing of over and hour and then flight cancelled as were other on that day why does ba continue to provide such poor service  a national disgrace
not verified   the worst service ever my baggage did not arrive on time both my flights were delayed i will never fly them again  even the food was bad and your service
 trip verified    flights we booked this holiday were delayed about  hours no wifi available on  of  flights food and drinks very basic and expensive cannot recommend
 trip verified   british airways has a total lack of respect for its customers i was booked to fly from frankfurt main to london city airport and just a couple of hours before the scheduled departure the flight was suddenly cancelled by ba without explanation when i was already at the airport the worst thing was the utter callousness that staff showed towards customers the ground staffs attitude was that they are merely third party agents not ba employees and therefore they quickly washed their hands of us all telling us we had to contact ba directly via phone if we wanted help they couldnt even provide us a phone number telling us to look it up on bacom  so ba abandoned its passengers they did tell us that the ba departure to heathrow had also been cancelled meaning there would be no further ba flight from frankfurt to london that day although other airlines were still operating the route but ba refused to rebook us on them the reason given for both cancellations was technical reasons no assistance or information was provided on our rights due to cancellation nor any information on help regarding food accommodation help etc their attitude was literally that the cancellation had nothing to do with them and it was our problem not theirs i received an email an hour later notifying me that i had been automatically rebooked on an alternative flight  hours later which wasnt acceptable as i had to get back to london that night i rang bas call centre and again they showed a high degree of callousness  of the halfhour call was spent with me waiting on hold with the phone just cutting off after half an hour and no meaningful information given to me by that point there was no attempt by the call operator to call me back when the line cut and i had a solid phone signal and wifi as i was still standing in terminal  of frankfurt main airport even though my phone number is listed in my booking contact details they just dont care in the end i had to arrange my own return to london by taking a coach to hanh airport which was km away  waiting there for  hours and then booking an expensive last minute ticket with ryanair to stansted at least that flight operated on time and got me back to london ba is worse than a low cost carrier now
 trip verified  london heathrow to keflavik iceland in business class on an a british airways provides an unusual business class experience for intraeurope flights the seating is similar to most airlines  middle seat vacant and little extra space  but on british airways the business class cabin extends to almost half the aircraft this makes it less than a premium experience at every step from boarding to onboard the wifi worked for only half the flight and there are no refunds but when it worked it was surprisingly fast service on this flight was very good and we got to keflavik on time
 trip verified  mumbai to london heathrow in business class on an ageing b this aircraft featured the older club world flatbed seats they are comfortable there is enough storage space around the cubicle and the monitor screen is among the larger ones ive seen on airplanes bas new club suites are said to be far superior competing with the best bclass rivals the entire business class cabin had just  washrooms but it wasnt an issue on this flight since the premier section wasnt at full capacity there was wifi on board fast enough to even send videos via messaging apps service onboard was competent but the staff lacked warmth the food was alright and no more the biggest plus of this flight is that it gets out of bombay at  pm in the afternoon instead of the ungodly early morning hours most international flights take off from india the airport experience is far more pleasant at this time in summary british airways provides a good but not spectacular business class product
 trip verified   care and support shocking written by a previously loyal ba traveller lies and misleading unprofessional service told that my flight was cancelled booked on to next available flight in downgraded cabin from business to premium economy called to ask why told technical fault with my original flight my suspicion was another reason at airport check in staff said that not enough crew to staff original flight earlier in day why take my money and allow me to book a flight which would have allowed me to get to work as a doctor in the first place how can you trust such an organisation to look after you as a flying customer
 trip verified   flying a business class should be a pleasure but ba has made it a disaster with the worst seating and configuration imaginable how could any sane person could jam so many seats into a limited space and expect passengers to be happy seats are narrower than economy on some airlines and you must face another person until a plastic screen is raised the tv screens are the size of a medium sized tablet and the controls are behind your head in a sitting position there is no where to put anything except one small pull out draw at ground level that can not be reached when seated nor accessed when sleeping  the window seats and middle seats are accessed by having to jump over a passenger on an aisle seat and the seats are so low that they are hard for elderly to get out of the whole business class set up is a sick joke eating is difficult because the seat is not close enough to the table and the tables are so flimsy that drinks can fall off are there any redeeming features  the answer is no if you like a little comfort avoid ba like the plague
 trip verified   british airways absolutely does not care my reserved seat was change from an aisle to center seat for this overnight full flight and it was quite awful after enquiring at lax check in the agent said sorry nothing we can do onboard the flight the attendants seemed to try and finish the meal service at a racing speed with meals trays passed out with no proper questions about choice then back and clearing trays and they disappeared to rest in the kitchen for hours after that no water runs if you need anything do not bother with the call bell as they simply ignore it i used to like travelling british airways  years ago but the bean counters have been in and lowered it close to a lowcost carrier i guess staff are badly paid from their terrible attitude and service my last trip to london was with delta they are so much better than this very poor excuse of an airline that british air has now become
 trip verified   my recent experience with british airways was not just horrendous it was an utter abdication of responsibility on their part i arrived at jfk ready for my flight to malaga only to find it had been cancelled with zero notice after a draining hour altercation i was finally placed on a different flight the nightmare continued when i landed in malaga sans luggage containing essentials for my sons wedding thirty agonizing hours later the bags showed upbut my brandnew ipad and a special watch for my nephew were missing the items werent merely valuable they had emotional significance which made the loss even more gutwrenching youd think a reputable airline would make amends for such  errors  despite the clear mishandling of my baggage by their team they refused to offer any reimbursement or even a modest amount of airline credit their customer service was not only ineffective but also astonishingly callous their response was in essence its your fault for trusting us with your belongings this isnt just poor customer service its a complete disregard for basic human decency and responsibility british airways had numerous opportunities to right their wrongs and chose not to if you have any respect for your time belongings and emotional wellbeing avoid british airways at all costs they not only fail to deliver on promises but also refuse to make amends when they err leaving customers to bear the brunt of their incompetence
 trip verified   this is to express our displeasure and concerns regarding our flight to italy our trip was effectively ruined by the failure of our luggage to arrive with us coupled with the length of time it took for it to eventually reach us  and  days our departure dates june    flight ba  chicago to london june  rebooked by ba on ba  london to rome all flights were late on arrival in rome my wife was forced to walk to the checkin desk because our reservation for wheelchair assist from the plane was never transferred by ba she was told by the cabin crew that there was no reservation for her transport also our checked baggage  failed to make the ba rebooked flight from london to rome ba took  days to deliver my bag and  days to deliver my wifes i called ba baggage claim services daily i was frequently cut off after waiting on hold for over an hour we had apple air tags in both bags and sent pictures showing their exact location to ba baggage claim several times after  days ba stated that they found my wifes bag but needed to verify ownership both bags as described had bright pink  easily visible tags and bright pink bows taking  and  days to deliver them is inexcusable our return date july   ba  rome to london ba  london to chicago all flights were late we arrived in chicago more than  hours late missing our ground transportation to our home in michigan  hours away we had to find a hotel and stay overnight near chicago on july  we filed our expenses for replacement of lost clothing and toiletries also for food purchased at heathrow due to the flight delay and overnight hotel charges in chicago after  weeks i went online asking for some followup on both cases but have had no response at all from ba we are retirees on fixed income and cannot fund bas errors i can honestly say that the times i was able to reach a human being they were all courteous and attempted to help but appeared at a loss 
 trip verified   i flew london to malaga on  august in club europe we stood around at gate b in terminal  for over an hour with staff giving very different reasons for the delay late inbound aircraft etc  but the plane we boarded had been sitting there for more than an hour after boarding the captain stated that because they had changed planes there would be no meals served this is club europe and we received one small packet of crisps throughout the flight no effort to apologise we smelt the hot meal for pilots being heated and then saw it being served to them on a club europe meal tray cabin crew also had warmed pastries  and were very quick to use air freshener in the front galley while customers received zilch ba sent an email the following morning to say sorry  nothing else what a complete and utter rip off by an airline that is already cutting back on so many things i paid a full business class fare did not receive any part of the onboard meal service and they expect an email to be sufficient avoid ba if you have any other option nowadays they are the worst in europe
 trip verified   i arrived at the airport about  hours before takeoff to have more than about time to get checked in go through security etc all that went without any issues being that i was relatively early at the gate i was one of the first passengers there after some time boarding had opened first the business class got called up then families with children and disabled people a couple minutes into the boarding they started to call up people one by one by name then there was an announcement they wont let anyone in anymore me and about fifty other people were still standing at the gate not being let in the reason they said was that the plane was short staffed later i discovered speaking to a manager that not only the flight was short staffed but also it was overbooked after the announcement people were getting angry because they wouldnt be let in anymore nothing changed and everyone was sent away i had a connecting flight later that day that i was going to miss because i was not let on the plane first i tried to get my luggage back which i didnt receive immediately but got a hold of later on thanks to the airport personnel then just like everyone who was going to fly with the same plane i wanted to talk to someone from british airways since they dont have a service center at frankfurt airport everyone went to the checkin counters where we received food vouchers but not a single person was either able to rebook my or anyones flight nor get anyone refunded all the staff said was that we were going to receive an email in a couple hours with options to rebook the flight or get a refund i waited four hours for the email at the airport that did not come until today trying to call the airline did not help either because they did not answer the phone or hung up in the middle of the conversation after the four hours of waiting for the email me and some other people from the same flight went back to the checkin counter to get a confirmation from them that i will receive a refund being that there was a new shift the personell did not know what had happened when they scanned my passport an looked at the flight they found out that the system was dying that it was my fault i could not attend the flight it looked like i had missed it for everyone standing there with me it was exactly the same but the people at the counter said they could not do anything about it later on we were able to speak to the manager after many phone calls he said they were going to take care of it we are supposed to get an email at some point in the future i was not able to get a written confirmation that i will get refunded even after several times asking for it i already flew a lot of times in my life but never ever has such a thing a happened to me not only that me and so many other people were not let into the plane but also the customer service being so horrible that they were not able to rebook or confirm a refund in any way in the end the only option for me to get to my destination would have been to book a last minute flight for a lot of money which i would not know if i ever got it backed
 trip verified   filthy plane cabin staff ok appalling customer service staff who couldnt care less when dealing with a complaint paid extra for club europebusiness class food was poor they gave you wipes to clean your seat area yourself and we were split up so they could accommodate families not really what you expect when you pay for the extra service will be cancelling our other bookings we have with ba even if that means we lose our deposit
 trip verified    chaos at terminal  with ba cancellations and delays and staff give different reasons depending on who you ask  out  answers were lies sadly ba airport standards at t are worse than ever and we are long past being able to use covid as an excuse as a short haul club europe trip i expect very little from ba any more and they barely even provide that with cutbacks during covid that are now permanent if you can find an alternative carrier on the same route choose them rather than ba sadly on my route ba have a monopoly 
"not verified   ba cancelled our flight and could not book us onto any flight for the next  days i had to spend k in expenses to get us back with another airline  months later i am still waiting for reimbursement and have had no response to my  written complaints even the call centre staff tell me that head office have taken down the telephone number and email for the department who deal with this so even they cannot escalate or inquire utterly useless
"
 trip verified  when on our way to heathrow airport and merely  and a half hours before the scheduled departure we received an sms stating that our flight to johannesburg had been canceled an no reason given we were then put on the same flight one day later with no other choice offered as we were already at the airport we proceeded to check in to ask what caused the cancellation apparently the pilot was sick and there was nobody available on standby and what we could do about it the business class checkin desk assistant was unsympathetic and told us we could not check in our bags for the following day we found someone else who told us we could check them in  hrs prior to departure so we waited at the airport an further  hours and checked them in after which we went back home we were not offered a refund nor told how to claim for the extra expenses incurred train change fees for the connecting flight to zimbabwe loss of one night stay at a very expensive safari lodge etc we were not offered anything snooty unprofessional uncaring disorganised lack of service avoid british airways and find better and cheaper options
 trip verified  nice flight good crew very good seat food was what you would expect the aircraft had the new style business class seatssuite the actual plane as not new in any since of the word there were parts of the seat that were broken or missing however the seat still sat well and worked seat was also long enough to really lay out and get some sleep the video system worked great and had plenty of content the headphones however were cheap and didnt feel or work particular good the layout on this  had a lot of business class seats a lot we sat in the forward cabin enter aircraft turn left and that cabin is the quieter part of the aircraft the crew was very nice and were there the entire time for any needs or wants we might have had one draw back to the seats is as we were traveling as a couple the middle divider didnt open enough to really feel like you and your mate are traveling together lhr is what it is crowded and expansive but we had a good lounge visit and were completely on time for all flights
 trip verified    months have passed and still wasting my time with the ba team sharing the same documents again and again our flight from delhi to london got delayed in december  so we missed the connecting flight from london heathrow to vancouver ba put us on a flight after  hours on reaching vancouver we were told our baggage was lost such a horrible experience and their customer relations person did not even look into the details already shared in december january april and july 
 trip verified   in june my flight was cancelled within three hours of departure was given a rebooking the next day and they lost my suitcase it arrived three days later today  th august   it happened again offer of rebooking in two days when trying to post a claim the website doesnt work never again ba
 trip verified   ground and cabin crew always provide good customer service when it comes to catering club class has been reduced to what economy was on flight ba the ravioli pasta had dried out along the edges my slice of camembert was dried why bother serving it my bread roll white olive bread was dry i wonder whether anyone in ba monitors that club class has become economy when you get crying babies and noisy children in club class  now its a glorified soulless bus trip without britishness
 trip verified   my family flew from washington to london on a british airways a we were able to secure seats on the upper deck for a pretty hefty fee our flight was unfortunately delayed by  hrs from  to  causing us to miss a connection from gatwick to turin and making it so that no lounges were open by the time we got to the airport onboard i sat in a window seat which had a nice luggage bin which was very convenient for all my stuff in flight entertainment system didnt work very well the touchscreen was disabled and the controller was quite glitchy and hard to use it could use updating the food for dinner was decent they had pasta with tomato sauce which tasted good by airline standards the seat was pretty comfortable and the flight was smooth after we missed our connection and were stuck behind security for  hrs waiting for escorts they rebooked us on a flight from heathrow to milan the next day gave us free bus tickets to heathrow gave us a free hotel room and gave us dinner and breakfast vouchers great customer service
 trip verified   easy check in a t galleries south and north lounges packed only just able to get a seat didnt stay long as b gates lounge much quieter flight boarded smoothly and on time a upper deck old club world seating which is beginning to age a little however like the large toilets on this aircraft type cabin crew were all fantastic one family had tech issues with their seats and entertainment systems which crew worked hard on though sadly without success food and drink options were all very good entertainment was good overall an enjoyable flight
not verified   flight delayed by an hour it happens no biggie had us change our gate at the airport never happened before but i guess its ok gate agent asked us to check our bags and after telling him we would prefer not to do that he did it anyway second gate agent reassigned our seats from exit row to regular which is a huge squeeze my for  travel bud 
not verified  the staff are very rude and not trained properly no exceptions are made for children and elderly people the price of the ticket is very expensive given the distance and the service is extremely extremely poor
 trip verified   good domestic flight operated by ba cityflyer ground service at checkin edinburgh airport was particularly friendly and helpful the flight departed on time and arrived earlier than scheduled a complimentary drink and snack albeit tiny were served generally it seems that the quality of the cityflyer subsidiary is superior to the mainline british airways flights
not verified  failed at all basic travel fundamentals  our flight was delayed  staff demanded that we check in our carry on luggage even though we met our carry on allowance the fact that we have a tight bus connection was totally ignored  staff were quite unpleasant
 trip verified   they lost my baggage in a very simple situation its been three weeks and they dont care no communication whatsoever i was at the connection checkpoint at heathrow hrs before my connecting flight the last leg of my trip an agent insists on checking in my hand luggage since my plane is full and then they lose it i claim it at the arrival airport immediately now its been three weeks no communication whatsoever the online status is still searching for your bag with no updates my conclusion is that the ba males no effort to find my missing bag and they dont care 
 trip verified   late boarding led to a one hour flight leaving two hours late a single ba staff member turned up to board a full flight shortly before the flight was due to depart there had been no previous announcement of the delay once on board the captain blamed frankfurt ground staff for delaying takeoff when clearly late boarding had resulted in a missed departure slot
 trip verified  as usual the flight is delayed ba try to blame someone for the inability and incapacity of delivering what they sell why dont you hire enough personnel to fulfil your staff demand 
 trip verified   i had the most fantastic ba flight today the cabin crew in my seat zone d were of the best i have experienced although the  had the old style rearfront seating  it was comfortable and felt open and spacious ba have done great things with the menu  it was nice not to have to eat breakfast food on the prearrival meal into hkg at pm local time having left london at  the night before the dinner offering was equally ample and delicious the inflight entertainment had a great collection of tv and current films and the inflight map was first rate previously not a huge ba fan  but after this  hour flight i could only recommend it without reserve i flew the new ba suite in j class on a recent delhi to london flight and enjoyed that product although i felt it slightly more cramped  but i think ba have stepped up with really comfortable bedding and food and very friendly crew who engaged throughout the flight in the best way couldnt recommend ba more on this flight today
 trip verified   couldnt book in online arrived at check in to find we had been bumped off due to overselling no ba staff available very helpful gatwick staff got us a bus to lhr and a flight to toulouse had knock in effect on our car booking and sharing as the rest of family had been able yo board original flight airlines should be legally stopped from selling seats twice
 trip verified  london heathrow to mumbai in a boeing  in business class the lounge near terminal  gate b at heathrow was outstanding in its service and offerings it provides us just the right frame to relax in before boarding as the departure was delayed by almost  hours the  on our flight featured the older club world seating not the best in class but comfortable enough i hear that the new club suites configuration is far superior british airways onboard service was outstanding in every respect all in all a very comfortable flight one minor irritant for some reason this aircraft was not fitted with wifi we got into mumbai at  am a civilized time to arrive
 trip verified  keflavk iceland to london heathrow on an a in business class the journey got off on an unpleasant note  the business class line at keflavk was so long that it looked like an economy class checkin it took over  mins to get through there was no lounge access offered the boarding process was well handled british airways business class seats for the club europe product are terrible  exactly the same as economy with the middle seat left vacant you dont even get extra pitch what made the overall product tolerable were the good onboard service and the inflight wifi also the fact that the flight leaves at a convenient midmorning time of  am
 trip verified  terrible experience with british airways i booked a flight with ba to travel from gibraltar to london heathrow on may   my flight was scheduled to leave at  pm in the afternoon i had originally planned on leaving my luggage at heathrow upon arrival and travelling to visit and overnight at my cousins place en route to gib airport a few hours prior to departure i checked my flight details and found out that my flight had been cancelled i had a connecting flight booked with westjet from london heathrow to vancouver the following day and i had to make that flight so it was imperative that i got to london i checked the ba website and couldnt find any other flights with them that would work so unfortunately i made the mistake of requesting a refund i managed to find a flight out of malaga that got me into london just after  pm so i booked that and then called british airways as i wanted to discuss compensation thats when they advised me that because i had requested a refund they used the phrase abandoned travel with them they were not prepared to do anything for me apparently i should have called them first and then they would have made the arrangements of course they dont explain that on their website  they just ask if you want a refund and then proceed and even when i plead my case with the agent at malaga airport and then followed up with customer relations several times via email they flat out refused to budge i had used a travel voucher to cover the cost of my flight and had used avios to cover the cost of my checked baggage so in other words no out of pocket costs for the trip once this incident happened i ended up spending  euros in airfare and checked baggage charges to get to london from malaga ie different airport than the one i had originally booked from and because the luggage storage facility at heathrow had closed by the time i eventually arrived i ended up booking a night at a hotel since i couldnt travel by train to my cousins place any longer  bags in tow and i didnt want to put him out and have him drive to the airport to pick me up this cost me another  in room and meal costs all ba ended up doing to compensate me was to give me  free avios  a mere pittance compared to my out of pocket expenses despite trying to explain to them why i requested the refund instead of calling them first they wouldnt budge very easy for them to say what i should have done since they work there and know the rules and they werent the ones scrambling to find alternative travel arrangements within a few hours i pointed out that on their website they should simply instruct customers to call them when this situation happens and that way they would never encounter this problem my feeling is that they put the refund option out there in the hope that customers will make the mistake i did so they can then wash their hands of the situation and ultimately save money ive been an executive club member for years and they simply didnt care they said there was nothing they could do im sure if one of the ba executives friends or family members had gone through this staff there would have been given the instruction to make things right i used to be a fan of ba but they have really gone downhill in my opinion once i used up my remaining avios and travel credit i will cancel my executive club membership and never fly with them again
 trip verified  an airline that lives in their past glory and heading a future of crisis is british airways i am not joking we are a family of  all in business class heading for a norwegian and arctic cruise and they lost  of our bags they will never see me on any of their flights ever a disaster of an airline
 trip verified   checkin desk rude and dismissive flight late but seems the new norm one world emerald club world checkin staff uncommunicative did not know what baggage allowance entitled to once raised politely became argumentative and accusatory
 trip verified  i chose british airways especially because i was going to travel with my niece and nephew and wanted everything to work well what a disaster first it took me two hours to do the checkin online due to a technical problem i also had to spend more than  minutes in a call to a uk number from my spanish cell phone because thats the only service they provide on weekends then at the airport when there was the boarding time we had to wait with the rest of the people for almost two hours standing on the line without knowing what was going on they just told us to wait finally we could access the plane after  minutes inside they told us to leave the plane again and told us the flight had been cancelled we had to take our luggage and queue again for a couple of hours then do the check in again and wait for another flight to take off which was again delayed we spent almost  hours at the airport no information was provided no solutions were offered we had to seat in the last raw when i had paid to seat on the first half of the plane no money was refunded no apologizes or compensation was given i also had prepurchased food and they couldnt provide the service all in all terrible never again
not verified  i booked premium economy from inv to lax via lhr they notified me of a cancelled flight on my return journey and rebooked me on a flight that my connecting flight arrived too late for then they cancelled a flight on my journey to lax they then cancelled the rebooked flight on the return journey and rebooking me back on the first flight that they had rebooked me on  the flight that i have no chance of making as my return flight arrives too late into lhr they rerouted me from lax to jfk to lhr  which i would have accepted  but they booked the journey in economy lax to jfk which my husband  with a knee injury  cannot do and now they wont change it  even though they have a direct flight from lax to lhr with premium economy and unacceptable flight allows us  mins to transfer flights at jfk  and my husband wont be able to walk slowly let alone quickly after enduring the hour flight from lax to lhr i have chatted only to have my calls disconnected and i also have online chat which proves i did not accept this rerouted flight to jfk but they wont budge
 trip verified  a simple story with an unfortunate outcome that really could happen to anyone my partner and i recently started working after studying purchased two tickets to travel from london city airport to frankfurt when we purchased the tickets i mistakenly entered my name twice eg mr john smith and ms john smith little did we know that our  simple mistake would cost us over  pounds upon arriving at the airport we were told there was no way to change the name apparently they can only change  letters where there has been a typo and i had no other option to purchase the last remaining ticket if i wanted to board the flight  the price almost seven times  higher than my original ticket zero empathy was shown zero alternative was offered trusting bas staff and under the pretence that there was apparently no other way we could board the flight we bought this ticket immediately after i purchased the ticket i contacted bas commercial change booking team and informed them of our situation the service representative apologised and told me they could have changed the name at the cost of a small fee he offered to cancel my original ticket and issue me a partial refund then advising me that i had a claim to the difference and i should contact customer support to do so i told this person several times i wanted to claim the cost of the new ticket and even asked him explicitly if by accepting this offer i would be denied from claiming the cost of the new ticket he said no i could claim the difference fair enough  we accepted this offer and lodged a ticket with customer support for the difference two days later british airways customer response informed us that we were unable to lodge a claim because we had voluntarily accepted the cancellation before the flight theyve continued to send generic emails until this week when they just stopped responding so in short british airways misled and deceived my partner into accepting a lowball offer to waive our right to claim a refund it keeps me up at night thinking how they can do this and get away with it so easily
 trip verified   flight was delayed due to the inbound flight arriving late there was no announcement to inform of the delay nor were the sceens updated when ready to board we were requested to take our seats quickly to help reduce the delay which people did the pilot then announced he had received the documents for the wrong flight from ground staff so we had to wait while they returned to get the right paperwork after this was resolved the pilot announced there would be a delay as there was only two push back tractors and we had to wait again so after rushing to sit quickly we sat the the aircraft at the gate for nearly one hour which is longer than the flight takes  of course ams is not bas home base and it uses contracted staff here but it should require a better level of service it was embarrassing hearing the pilot apologise at every step of the way itll be eurostar for me next time
not verified   fast and friendly check in total contrast to gatwick the contract lounge is comfortable and spacious with a bar and pleasant staff but you have to pay for alcohol after the one free glass of wine food best avoided on board great crew and dinner was actually good quality and substantial apart from the chocolate and orange pot that seems to appear on every flight  have they bought up the global stock the crew were always ready to top up drinks although white wine and beers were lukewarm the crew explained that the carts are supposed to be chilled  from experience they rarely are is dry ice so expensive that ba cant afford it
 trip verified   i dont understand why british airways is classified as a  star airline the service is really mediocre the food is untasty and insufficient for a long haul trip some members of the cabin crew are friendly but they are not attentive enough and create a very basic experience this really is all about getting from point a to b without what it used to be an enjoyable trip making experience the inflight entertainment is fairly good but you do need to bring your own water not to get dehydrated some snacks and ideally food and perhaps smile to yourself as otherwise you are faced with just a cold personality less experience 
not verified   im sure that ba have gradually made their economy experience ba euroflyer out of gatwick so miserable that passengers are tempted to upgrade to the lacklustre and overpriced business class long wait at the biz checkin  due to status  and dealt with by a bored agent  ok third party but still representing ba  who hardly spoke and avoided eye contact and was more focussed on her fingernails lounge was crowded and grubby but at least the staff there are pleasant and helpful on board the seats are cramped and uncomfortable and it took over two hours before crew appeared with food sales and the free water which on gatwick services consists of a half full plastic cup rather than the luxury of a small bottle a fellow passenger mentioned the delay and the fact that they had no sandwiches for sale which prompted the flight attendant to say that the service was much better on easyjet who do two service runs etc
 trip verified   customer service does not exist one world emerald frequent long haul flyer including ba  never seen such poor customer service or computer says no official bacom site said all morning and afternoon that flight from gatwick delayed  hours delayed leaving for airport only for ba to change back to original time called ba customer service  hours prior from highway saying situation  told not to worry would note and flight rebooked if issue but go to airport got to airport  mins prior told could not board and that staff did not work for ba so could not help back on phone  hours in total to be told could be rebooked then couldnt be round and round ultimately told to file complaint then found out flight left  hours delayed paid for extra hotels flights with more competent airlines and now told  days wait for complaints to be responded to  heavens help economy and nonstatus flyers if thats what the front end of the plane gets
 trip verified  another really great pair of flights on time no problems at all champagne was ok and my meal choices were great the new club suite is a good improvement over the previous seat in flight entertainment could have been better cant wait to fly with ba again and enjoy another great experience
not verified   our a developed a fault taxiing to the runway  we returned to the gate only to then have the flight cancelled about  hours later due to a technical fault all the while ba staff were virtually nonexistent it was finally the captain who announced the flight was cancelled ba provided an alternative the next day involving a connection but it was very much take this or else you were on your own no arrangements or help made with overnight accommodation or transport  finally managed to get the legal minimum  compensation out of ba for the  hour delay they caused to my journey and expenses were reimbursed too but even this took four weeks the fact that as a business class customer ba pays the minimum they can get away with says it all  they couldnt care less about customers have no interest in loyalty and arent bothered about your business given its our flights that pay bas way id suggest to anyone they take their hard earned cash to another airline who might at least care less about their customers not recommended 
not verified  horrible airline does not care about their customers used to be decent but has now since really fell off a flight time of  hours and  mins but no meal while the flight attendants were having their eggs and sausage in the back didnt even offer juices i would stick with another airline
 trip verified   my family and i have flown mostly on british airways for the last  years i am a priority passenger and fly often enough to recognise cabin crew and know some by name they used to be a really good airline to fly with things have really deteriorated with their face to face customer care since the pandemic the aircraft look worn for example on my flight back my audiovisual equipment did not work and had to be reset twice finally working in the last hour before we landed the second time around i think the reset was done for the whole aircraft the touch screen function on my screen did not work the usb charger ports on my seat did not work the staff were pleasant enough but their service oozed mediocrity  there did not seem to be much pride in what they were doing the food has been the worst part on our ba flights since the pandemic they gave us a menu asked what wed like did a check and then told us that it was not available as they had run out and would we like to choose something else they then told us that wed get first choice at the second service which they couldnt deliver on finally after choosing and getting whatever it is that we did the food was tasteless we take part in post flight surveys regularly and have stated all of this to no avail as a family of  we fly british airways medium to long haul regularly possibly  times a year each for us the good things about flying ba are that we are priority customers usually have a direct flight to our destinations and get good service on the ground when checking in and in the lounges when we use them
 trip verified   this has been by far the worst service i have had on a plane its very obvious that if you are flying economy and not a frequent traveler of british airways they care very little about you we had to wait an hour for them to even open the checkin once they did they had  lines and only one that serviced economy even though the line for economy was three times the length of the premium classes then they told economy passengers that all bags had to be check and no carryon due to a full flight and no room in the overhead compartments once we arrived at the gate there were not enough seats to fit everyone and you couldnt leave the boarding area i will never fly this airline again 
 trip verified   in nov  i booked and paid for a return journey to new zealand on my return journey my final flight was from london to edinburgh on trying to check in i was told my ticket did not exist i showed evidence of my flight being booked and paid for but was denied a ticket my only option was to buy a ticket for a later flight which cost  since nov  ie  months ago i have communicated multiple times with ba in an attempt to have my money returned they have admitted responsibility for their error which cost me  i finally received word from them that they have decided to refund me the sum of  i have asked for an explanation but have received none only a polite e mail informing me that the decision was checked and was correct i do not intend to let this matter go a company worth billions of pounds will not return an honest refund ps they also lost my luggage and did nothing to help me retrieve it i tracked it down myself a week later to edinburgh airport and picked it up myself
not verified  ba is not treating its premium economy passengers with respect you pay for a premium economy service and are then compelled to use the economy toilets at the back of the plane this is shortchanging passengers 
 trip verified    hours before our departure on ba to cape town from heathrow on thursday th june we did an online checkin seats had already been allocated for my wife and i   e and f  which are the middle two seats of the central block of four these were totally unsuitable for us as we are in our late s and getting in and out of seats to stretch our legs or go the the toilet would mean climbing over a person on the aisle but there were no other seats available we got to heathrow about  hours before departure and tried to change seats at checkin to no avail although the lady was very sympathetic and tried her utmost she did offer us an upgrade to premium economy but at gbp each it was beyond our affordability she said we should try again at the departure gate but that also failed we spoke to a member of the flight crew who was totally unsympathetic the economy seats are so tiny that i was jammed shoulder to shoulder between by wife and a stranger with knees touching the seat pocket in front for  hours we suffered when we did manage to get out of our seat due to the kindness of the young lady next to me on the aisle it was a mission trying to clamber past the reclined backrest in front of me ba economy is absolutely awful the evening meal was nearinedible  both choices were spicy foods which are not very suitable when flying especially for an older person the breakfast spanish omelette was however not bad at all the previous day we had flown economy from malta to heathrow on malta airlines and that  hour trip was a pleasure the seats are wide and there is ample legroom if they can do it then why not british airways
 trip verified   we arrived at heathrow at  to find our flight to ibiza was cancelled by ba with no explanation as if that wasnt galling enough the customer service from ba at the airport was nonexistent there was no explanation no apology and no assistance in finding an alternative flight weve managed to find another flight from stansted but that isnt until much later today thus wasting a chunk of our short trip i simply dont understand why ba dont proactively contact their customers to notify them of a cancellation and work with them to resolve the problem shocking customer service
 trip verified   original flight was cancelled with no explanation there was no representative to help in rebooking we had to call customer service long distance call the line kept dropping had to do   calls to find new booking only to discover the only way i could fly the next day was by paying business class no help with hotel for the night stay
not verified   airport check in was functionary with little warmth but some efficiency flight was delayed with no communication given boarding was chaotic and no management of the process by ground staff seats on board are tight and you really feel like they have crammed in every seat possible there is next to no recline however i was thankful that there was no recline if the person in front had even the slightest recline they would be in my face owing to how tight the seats were spaced on this a aircraft no amenities on this flight except for a toilet that was clean but small no ife no food and beverage unless you pay extra but the staff were friendly luggage arrived at the carousel within a very short amount of time
 trip verified   flight fine inline with competitors pleasant crew only niggle is bussed to and from aircraft at heathrow it seems like this is standard for the berlin flights would use again
 trip verified   came from glasgow to london and took connecting flight american airlines from london to north carolina its my third day here in north carolina and still waiting for my luggage they didnt even bother to transfer the luggage to connecting flight luggage are still in glasgow 
 trip verified   my flight on on  may  got delayed an hour and  minutes which resulted in the cancellation of our connection flight on  may  as the arrival of the first flight was only  before the departure of the second connecting flight we contacted the ba call center multiple times to make changes to the flight in order to still arrive on the th of may to kef airport through different flights the team tried to find a solution but none made sense not even on the next day the th of may  we have made full booking of accommodation car rental activities etc for the vacation in iceland the cancellation of of these booking is not refundable the call center suggested that we cancel the flight for a full refund then claim compensation for the delay and difference in airfare cost and other non refundable bookings due to the delay and cancellation of our flight british airways responded to the claim after a month with no compensation at all even though we paid additional  on new bookings and additional charges the refund of the cancelled flight took more than a month with multiple calla to follow up almost every week i was promised to get refund on the first call but later i found out it was not processed properly everytime i call the agent ask questions about why flight was canceled etc which is annoying when my understanding everything was under process for payment after multiple calls i was refunded partially and not the full amount which is even bizarre from a company of this level i had to make more calls to get the remaining balance refunded the whole experience was terrible
not verified   cairo is a  hour flight and ba considers it to be short haul so everyone is crammed in with knees pressed up against the seat in front and nothing in the way of inflight entertainment not even a magazine  which is now available by wifi that you have to pay for you have to pay for your seat choice checked in baggage food  drink wifi not that i have anything against that  im used to that on budget airlines  but this is for a premium price ticket i would have preferred to fly on easyjet where the initial ticket would have been less and the extras would have been half the price the ba app and website makes it really difficult to understand the extras and we ended up with baggage on the wrong ticket so had to pay extra and dont get me started on their customer service helpline on board the staff are ok but on the long cairolondon route they spend most of their time on a break where they use the back row or two and talk loudly without any consideration for the passengers and for the flyers who dont want the hassle of charges minimal cabin service and budget seats then they could easily provide a premium economy option  and really make a difference for the experience heathrow terminal  compounds the poor experience especially for arrivals it is also poorly served by transport links  especially for those of us who live near gatwick which is being abandoned by ba i have been a frequent flyer for many years  and was even a ba gold card holder at one point  so i know about the potential experience i used be able to make the choice  do i fly budget or do i fly more comfortably for more now its a case of flying budget or flying budget for double the price with ba 
 trip verified   after travelling london to madrid with british airways then with iberia from madrid to lima and latam to cuzco my luggage arrived  days after me when attempting to collect my luggage mine was the only one not to arrive i sought help and was informed to make a claim online when my bag finally arrived  days later the lock had been forced open and everything inside the case searched someone emptied my st aid kit and toiletries and threw my clothing about i felt violated i have been treated appallingly from start to finish for a month i have been back and forth to british airways yet they stated it is not their fault 
 trip verified   my luggage was mistagged in dallas on my way to cairo via london my luggage arrived at lhr as planned on saturday  however upon arrival due to the luggage being mistagged and having the incorrect name on my luggage it was never sent to cairo its sitting in terminal  in lhr i have an air tag on my luggage and british airways is saying there is nothing they can do about it i have filed  claims made  phone calls have been hung up on x and as simple as it is to solve this problem the workers at ba refuse to solve the problem 
 trip verified   the airline lost my luggage and was absolutely awful throughout the entire trip they gave me no updates their website sucks and it was nearly impossible to get someone on the phone they finally delivered my luggage to my hotel after i had left to go back to the us  days after i told them to ship it back to the us now ive been calling everyday begging them to get my bag back to me they appease me on the phone tell me theyre fixing it but nothing changes the hotel cant get in touch with them and they havent even tried to pick to bag back up several times when i called i got a message saying they were not answering due to too many complaints and calls and to call back later 
 trip verified   we booked on the ba website round trip flights from seattle to amman with a stop in london in business class our first flight was delayed and then diverted to nyc and enroute my husband experienced a medical emergency when we landed in nyc we were taken to a hospital and i stayed in constant contact with the airline agent who had arranged for the ambulance transfer the same evening we flew back home confirming cancellation of all remaining flights with the agent at the airport for the next several weeks we spoke many times with ba customer service trying to obtain some kind of refund  we were met with contradictory explanations excuses and an absence of meaningful customer service we discovered we had been marked as noshows for our flight to amman and that our return flight was still active we were unable to cancel the return on the website despite booking on the website our phone calls were never returned we spent a minimum of  minutes on hold for every phone call we made our emails received only canned replies without answers or explanations we were told it was not possible to receive a copy of the ticketing rules and regulations nor to speak with a supervisor and after several weeks of this abysmal customer service i filed a complaint with the faa in response to my complaint i received an email from ba customer service explaining that they had reviewed my many requests for a full refund but that could not be accommodated due to the ticketing rules they would issue flight credits  except for the portion for which we noshowed they did not state how many credits we never once asked for a full refund  we asked to read the rules and to receive a partial refund we will not use the credits  we were fully refunded by our travel insurance
 trip verified   first time flying with ba business class never again there are no boarding drinks provided my meal quality was below business class standards as was the quality of the wine on arrival at bodrum my bags were among the last to appear not looking forward to the same chaos on the return flight 
not verified  you can buy sandwiches and crisps but dont expect a hot meal because the plane is a narrow body  there are no screens not helping matters is the fact that the ba prebooking shop for food didnt recognise the flight number and the onboard  wifi didnt work 
 trip verified   this is a twoforone review covering economy and business class on the ba flight from london city to ibiza economy was excellent a very light lunch small cheeseandpastrami sandwich chocolate brownie followed by a pretty much freeflowing drinks trolley the flight was full but the crew worked hard and did a very good job this is a flight i would recommend except dont fall for the last minute offer for an upgrade to business for  in each direction as i did i flew economy out and business back while my brother flew business then economy the business seats are identical to economy with no seats blocked so you are squished in four abreast the meals are almost identical with minor tweaks such as a yoghurt for your  the only real plus is champagne but on my flight there was none because of supply issues the cabin attendant i think his name was tom must be one of the best in the business i didnt eat so i paid  for nothing oh well so great flight but stick with economy
 trip verified  absolutely horrible airline communication is terrible last minute delays cancellations seat changes with no communication app and website user experience is years behind other airlines seats are cramped and uncomfortable overpriced would not fly again
 trip verified   having experienced delays and cancellations departing from usa to europe and now a  hour estimated delay at lhr heading back to usa i would warn travelers that ba has become unreliable and is now on my do not fly list until they get better organized 
 trip verified  travelled to heathrow to kalamata and return journey  days later world traveller aka economy class both flights departed on time return flight landed early  but  we then had a   hour wait for the baggage to be offloaded which rather ruined the journey home as we then caught a motorway closure flights ok  fas particularly on return flight pleasant enough but as usual economy class seating was truly dreadful  no legroom at all no better in club class either  only the middle seat left free marked down because of this can only recommend if you are not tall
not verified   this flight failed at every level we were delayed and arrived at our destination late so that our prepaid car transfer phoned to advise us that he could only wait another  minutes for us but this was a ba holiday we pre ordered food for our flight and this was never loaded onto our flight and to finally compound british airways complete and utter uselessness our luggage was still in heathrow as there is no flight tomorrow the earliest this luggage could possible arrive is very late on wednesday evening having only the clothes that you flew in and reading you can only claim for toiletries and underwear seems to be the antithesis of a happy holiday i might have expected a complimentary scone in lieu of no food but no we were told that we could purchase from the trolley what they had available i would like to make it clear that we are british airways bronze level holders which as we have been long retired shows how we have used this airline historically
not verified   beware of british airways and their marketing to make you believe that they are full of class and level above the rest they wont treat you that way when you get bumped from a flight and it is their responsibility to compensate you for their mistakes we recently had a trip home planned from mrs to sea a mechanical issue meant that we departed late from mrs to lhr where we needed to make a connecting flight we landed with plenty of time to make it to our next gate but a series of issues and choices by british airways kept us from boarding our next plane the crew did not let off passengers with connecting flights first nor did they hold the next flight for a mere  minutes for passengers to make connections on their airlines plus we discovered that we had actually been bumped off our next flight before we even landed we were pushed to virgin atlantic to figure out how to get us home it extended our travel day by  hours we were traveling with children as well no offers of compensation or upgrades were made and now ba is refusing to provide us any financial compensation we paid for a trip home with only one connection and instead had two connections multiple airlines to deal with security through an extra airport with kids for a midnight flight we were never planning on that is not what we paid for but ba refuses to make it right so beware potential travelers
 trip verified   i flew from cairo to heathrow on what they call euro club class which is a cramped coach seat with the middle empty seat horrible service i get to heathrow airport  minutes late so i had to run around looking for my connecting flight finally jumping through escalators and train to another building where is my gate given a seat that is different than what i paid extra for  its a shame for such well known airline
not verified  i flew with numerous airlines but i gotta admit british airways is by far the worst airline ever when it comes to customer support i waited  weeks for a ticket change call center workers are giving you false information just so they would make you hang up they told me i was supposed to get an email from them with the flight changes but never got they dont have a live chat just like american airlines do they dont have a online form to submit your questions they don t have a working international number total garbage
 trip verified   we were traveling as a family  people because of an accident by the airport we arrived at the airport only  hour before the flight the kiosk was unable to read one of our passports and we had to go to checkin the lady at the checkin checked the passport and gave us a boarding pass because we had no extra time we headed straight to security and didnt realize the lady gave us a duplicated boarding pass not of the passport holder we got stuck in security because of that couldnt figure out what was wrong we only didnt miss the flight because we ran through the airport with a  year old and a  year old included in the party the staff at the gate was very cordial and helpful once we arrived there
 trip verified  flight at am from dub to lcy cancelled pm night before no text message no phone waiting at bus stop and randomly checked email to see alternate flight option hang on whats this it was dark at am it was hard to see mobile phone screen im still jet lagged only option was to lhr at am tried calling no one there so accepted it but i didnt see the day change it was the next day i didnt want the flight as was staying at docklands hence choosing lcy but thought i better take it as its leaving an hour after the original flight nope i better call to say hey sorry i screwed up your flight is not going to work for me i dont have any more accommodation in dublin and i dont want to waste one night in london called the most surly customer service can you even be called that when you treat people like this answered she kept calling me james not my name she was brutal you accepted it i cant do anything she basically made me feel like a moron because in a moment of confusion i accepted the first available flight from the stupid supercomputer she kept telling me about the algorithm and this was the flight that was chosen but if you had called us we could have put you onto a aer lingus flight why didnt you call you are at fault just so callous and uncaring she wanted to charge me  pounds in new flights and change fees i said nope and booked a flight today with ryanair plus i need to find my way from gatwick to docklands more money from me because of bas utter contempt for their passengers ive been flying qantas for  years and they can do some funky stuff but never this level of cruelty because of one simple error never again how do people accept such utter contempt and ineptitude welcome to the uk just wow
 trip verified   terrible i have traveled twice with them this year via business class and they have been significantly delayed or cancellations with connecting flights the customer service or complete lack of it is appalling and has forced me to change credit cards as i no longer intend to use ba for any further flights terrible uncomfy old planes and miserable staff 
 trip verified   the customer service is ugly tried calling two weeks ago but still had problems with flight all i get is someone in india i thought i was flying iberia once i looked close at ticket it was british airways will never fly british airway ever again
 trip verified   most uncomfortable flight i have ever experienced its a long time since i have flown longhaul the cramped conditions were awful the rows were so close together when the person in front reclined their seat my tv was so close i couldnt focus on it  ba seem to want to make economy so uncomfortable to encourage customers to upgrade this has not worked on me i will avoid flying ba in future my onward flight was with latam same  aircraft but more room between rows far more comfortable on the return flight from santiago the lights were turned down at pm i feel the cabin crew do this to avoid providing a service they just disappear behind the curtains
 trip verified   i booked our first out of country trip to take my husband on a surprise trip to monaco i gave us over  hours for our connecting flight to and from home through heathrow our flight left seattle an hour late causing us to miss our connecting flight we were rescheduled before we even landed they booked us on a flight  hours later and offered no food tickets or any other type of reimbursement additionally we sat in their customer service line for an hour and a half to see if they could rebook us on an earlier flight to watch them continually assist other customers that walked up outside of the queue no earlier flights were available when we arrived in nice france the airport was closed including the rental car desk we were not offered any assistance from the airline on a room or other accommodation for the night we found a cab which cost us  euros one one to get to our hotel we thought there is no way something like this could happen on the way homewe were wrong our flight from nice to heathrow was  minutes late with a  hour layover you would think we should still make our flight unfortunately long security lines caused over  hr further delay when arriving ba closed the doors and said they could not hold the plane any longer despite arriving mins before departure after running through the heathrow airport and going through security again they sent us back to the customer service queue where the first statement was we cant get you out until tomorrow after begging they found us a flight on another airline at that time we were told our bags were transferred to our flight with delta we were given  pounds each for snacks at the airport for our now additional  hour delay in total for our trip there and home we spent  hours at heathrow airport which our original total layover of  hours and we were offered  pound each unfortunately the drama continues the two bags that they said made the delta flight shockingly did not we were told that we had the file the claim with delta since the last part of our flight was with them we have now been home for  days and each airline is pointing the finger at the other as i said to both of them today i dont care who has my bags figure it out and send me my luggage i dont want your  reimbursement per bag as that doesnt come close to the memories and stuff that i have in there i will never fly british airways again and deltas baggage people are not doing great either
 trip verified  my husband and i booked seats within our premium economy booking on both outward journey ba on  february and return on  march we were last or almost last to be served food each time they had run out of our choices on one occasion i did not eat as only available option was curry which disagrees with me on all flights there appeared to be an undue focus on curryspicy food all in all very disappointing and left us with a very poor opinion of british airways
not verified   may  flew from seattle to heathrow then to edinburgh ba lost my golf bag which caused me to purchase golf shoes club rentals tees balls i had tee times at two courses in st andrews that took months to make the promised my bag returned in  hours and they would reimburse occurred expenses i contacted ba and they state they would only reimburse toiletries then the return flight home was randomly canceled by ba without notifying me or without notice two weeks before the scheduled flight i contacted the corporate travel team they informed me ba canceled my return reservation they rebooked me on the same flight ba customer service was horrendous and make false promises i will never use this airlines again beware of british airways they also randomly canceled my girlfriend and her fathers flight and they are both gold members
 trip verified  i went through three flights to reach my destination all of my ba flights without exception were delayed both on my way to my destination and back from my destination which is understandable to an extent whats not understandable is that they werent prepared for one of the flights and delayed by almost an hour so i ended up missing a flight and for that they rebooked me h ahead providing only accommodation which they messed up as well and after  hours of traveling i had to wait and hope that the hotel would find an extra room since ba didnt communicate properly with them i gave ba a chance to correct their mistake by contacting them after the flights but all they did was answer once with a lot of serious complaints that were involved with their flights and all they did was tell me to contact their partners that i had the last flight with which went smoothly and they had nothing to do with the previously addressed complaints i contacted them and gave them over a week asking why they didnt address any of my complaints that their partner could have nothing to do with and they just ghosted me  for the kind personnel thats holding this airline together though
 trip verified  an excellent flight in club world on british airways the welcome aboard was warm and that continued throughout the flight the crew were attentive friendly and very professional on board food for dinner and breakfast was good and there was a well chosen selection of wines in flight entertainment offered a great selection of films and audio the seatflat bed was very comfortable  british airways have done an excellent job in the design and comfort of the suites on board the a i liked the sleek minimalist design this flight showed that ba can be among the worlds best airlines
 trip verified  the flight schedule was delayed for one hour after boarding the plane we were delayed at least another  minutes when we arrived in london we were delayed again for at least another  minutes to find a gate we were left with  minutes only to catch our connecting flight to barcelona we needed to run and take the train to different terminal to catch our next connecting flight when we arrived at barcelona airport we discovered that our check in luggage was still in london very painful trip disrupted our vacation not flying with ba anymore if i can find alternative airlines 
 trip verified  the worst experience in all my years of travel my first flight with my two kids from boston to london was delayed by  hours resulting in me missing my connecting flight despite having a layover of approximately  hours i ended up waiting until  pm to board my flight to cairo unfortunately even that flight was delayed i would strongly advise avoiding this particular airline even if it means paying a bit more for a different option
 trip verified   the worst experience in all my years of travel bag was destroyed flight delayed  hours and couldnt get water on board then when attempting to claim on their website the entire site failed on a dropdown menu that wouldnt work you cant contact them plane was filthy and someone elses belongings and left over food was still in our seat
 trip verified   terrible delays had to rebook our domestic travel for  passengers and havent received any reimbursement on the same lost all my luggage received luggage after  days had to purchase new clothes for the family for a wedding no customer service rep picks up the phone
 trip verified   a serious medical problem appeared while i was onboard i informed the crew and they helped me out unfortunately i was in transit but travelling further became too difficult because of how unwell i became also i could not find my way back home in my condition thankfully the crew has helped me in every step of the journey until i returned back home it was a stressful experience but the crew of british airways made it way more tolerable
 trip verified   i havent flown british airways before and will never fly them again the checkin process was terrible and slow there were over  people in the regular check in line and they had two agents working it they had one agent working the first class line it should not take that long to check people in especially when people should have checked in online ahead of time our group checked in online and almost missed our plane because of the slow counter service we had to run to the gate and we did make it but they were terrible
not verified   my itinerary was supposed to be las vegaschicagolondonvenice when i landed in london heathrow i was stuck on the aircraft for  hours with no explanation as to why and because of such a delay i missed my connecting flight to venice getting off the plane was when the real nightmare took place our flight had over  people aboard meaning many were in a rush to get to their flights or had already missed their flight they put us into two lines one of them being for people who missed their flight i waited approximately  minutes just to come up to a clerk who told me since i missed my flight i would have to go to the connecting flight ba service desks for further assistance if i were to have known that was the only information i would receive i would have skipped being in that line altogether when i went to the service desk where there were more than  people standing in line i waited  minutes until a clerk came by passing everyone a pamphlet telling people to create an account online and to book our flights through the ba site since their systems were down and couldnt rebook anyone it was a hassle doing anything through he ba site so i ended up calling the helpline after waiting to be connected to a ba rep i spoke with a woman who said i would have to call iberia airlines for a rebook i called iberia and they said since i booked through expedia i would have to call them expedia then said i would have to call ba for the rebook so when i called ba again the rep said the only flight he could get me booked for was for the following monday mind you i was travelling since the th which was a friday all the hotels in the vicinity of the airport were booked i was trying to figure out where my checked baggage went i still dont have it most of the customer service i got from ba reps was horrible service as if they could care less for the predicament their company caused me they acted like i was inconveniencing them with my issues i also had to sleep in the airport waiting for my flight the next morning because hotels were booked overall my experience with british airlines has been the worst airline experience ive ever had to deal with i will never book with this company again i would rather pay more money for a ticket in a different airline than buy through this company again
 trip verified   busy day at lhr and flight full lounge crowded but b gates lounge quieter flight left on time very professional crew greeted by name and executive club status acknowledged and thanked for return custom a nice touch service was good food average entertainment good early arrival quick processing at jfk all good
 trip verified  worst seats i have ever encountered in economy class no leg room at all i had to spread my legs to fit staff at the terminal rude business class offers the same seat but with more legroom and they block the middle seat they cram people in seats with no legroom and block off the same seat type at the front of the plane where there is more legroom just so the business class passenger has an empty seat between them plane is old with no onboard entertainment for a  hours flight last time i will fly british airways
not verified  top ten reasons to not use british airways to all be aware and be on notice travel at your own risk i have travelled for years on many different airlines and i have to say that british airways ranks as one of the top two most horrible airlines to fly dont waste your time or money customer service is nonexistent please be on notice that if you purchase a ticket from them and once they have your money you can kiss any customer service and or help resolving your issue goodbye we used them to travel to europe and it was the worst experience i have had with an airline in years when you work hard and save your money to travel you expect a good experience welp not with this company who i am sure makes millions on customers per year i understand that sometimes things happen but this started right after we booked our flight and the bad experience did not end until we set foot back to our hometown please take note   the customer service number is buried on the internet and not listed on their website i had to google it and still got the run around when someone finally answered trust me the number is a secret   when you finally find a customer service number there is a long wait and when or if someone answers they will not resolve your issues instead they pass the buck to whatever airlines that they sold your ticket to no one takes ownership  what airlines operates  days a year and around the clock but doesnt have customer service reps to help you the customer british airways thats who   they will cancel your flight without notice and not notify you at all no email no text  if you are not the primary on your ticket you will get no notifications or even if you are the primary you may or may not get notifications   if you pay for seats and you pick them it doesnt matter they will cancel your seats and not refund your money and then play stupid   the flight may be cheaper but it is not once you are done paying for seats  they will route to another partner airline and not notify you   if you have a connecting flight they will cancel one leg and not the other and not notify you i will never use them again and if this review helps one person that heeds my advice then my job is done
not verified   easy check in on the way to heathrow the flight was on time with no issues our return flight to valencia was booked for the afternoon and our long haul flight arrived early at heathrow this was with another airline and was not a connecting flight i asked at the british airways check in if we could be put onto the morning flight back to valencia to avoid seven hours waiting at heathrow we had our flights changed with no cost and were checked in within five minutes that is indeed customer service thank you
 trip verified   online check in worked fine quick security check once onboard quick flight up to glasgow water and snack provided all in all very pleased cheap quick and efficient
 trip verified  the ba first lounge at terminal  was a  zoo at pm dirty tables and used tableware everywhere worse than this the usual atrocious boarding gate service and boarding started  mins late the flight was operated by a finnair a which is barely low cost standard let alone business class hard thin uncomfortable seats poor legroom and the cabin was simply tatty  i remain shocked that ba allow this and its time for bas ceo and management focused on standards rather than bean counting finnair cabin staff were fundamentally courteous but they provide a very trimmed down budget airline type service as the whole trip turned out to be  and yet this business class ticket was one of the more expensive on recent trips i thought post covid that ba were better for a few months but with the many cost cuts they are making they fall well below all other european full service airlines 
not verified  paid a quick visit to nice yesterday from heathrow decided to go business class since my last short haul flight in economy was a real crush and rather unpleasant i paid over  for a business class round trip i went into the to ba lounge in terminal  which was very crowded being  in the morning i decided against having a drink and stuck to the breakfast offering the cooked options did not look that appealing but the fresh fruit selection was very enjoyable we subsequently discovered a much nicer ba lounge closer to the gate b and waited there for  mins boarding was efficient and we got ourselves seated in a and c seat b was blocked out which acted as an additional table there did not seem to be any difference in the width of the seat from the cramped seating in economy but there may have been an additional inch of leg room i think that ba are trying to outdo easyjet in terms on no frills it would not cost ba that much to supply business class passengers with a complimentary newspaper to read during the flight the inflight magazine is no longer available there are no screens so there was zero in terms of in flight entertainment the inflight wifi was flaky at best and nonexistent at other times i was glad it was only a two hour flight i really do not think the fare that we paid was worth the money
 trip verified   words fail to describe this last awful flight  baby across the aisle crying for most of the flight and although horrible to go without any rest for the long flight lhrsfo its understandable for a baby to cry nonstop  but the crew yakking loudly in the galley even after a polite notification that their conversation could be heard in the cabin  that made the flight unbearable for any rest or sleep always difficult anyway westbound the food was so bad that most  turned down whatever the nasty offering was on the nd service what happened to the really nice tea and scones ive said this before after suffering through the ba concept of customer service ie dont do anything to help the passenger if it involves any extra work  this time i swear i mean it  never again on ba please the lounge was so packed even a single traveler had a hard time finding a seat  poor ba is on the skids downhill
 trip verified   absolutely terrible experience the app would not let me check in online and repeatedly asked for covid documents but then did not accept them even when provided i was trying to fly back to the usa where i am a citizen and the app caused repeated errors i went to british airways customer service to check in and was told that my seat was already given away to another passenger even though i was there in plenty of time this was also during an industrial action at heathrow meaning the number of flights were limited i was delayed over  hours in returning to the usa all because of their terrible app and then bad customer service that gives away seats even when the paid passenger is already there at the airport
 trip verified  ba overbook every flight to maximise their income with no regard for the customer it means you cannot check in online or at the kiosk in the airport and have to queue even with no luggage makes easyjet and ryanair look like customer champions the server in itsu in the ba terminal says she stopped flying ba years ago due to the service being bad all the time most customers she serves have a complaint staff dont care as poor service and unhappy customers is a routine occurrence
" trip verified   
the flights were all on time except belfast from london which never is the staff were efficient my issue is the app i could not book seats to tel aviv though tried for a month as wanted to pay so ended up in a middle seat even though a window seat was available on the flight the seat was in front of the dividing barrier and was used as thoroughfare by the service team throughout the flight so i wasted my money on pe seat you can get hold of ba customer service via the app either and they have just ignored all other communication so just wont use them again"
not verified  only the second time flying ba as first time wasnt positive could have made my connection in heathrow if ba had been proactive instead overnight at the renaissance hotel compliments of ba adequate but one wonders why a large part of this hotel is devoted to sleeping and feeding of hundreds of stranded passengers if ba had offered one employee to help us get to our gate instead of waiting for the shuttle bus which was a half hour late arriving we could have made our flight and saved ba the cost of rebooking hotel shuttle food accommodations another bad show business class fare should offer more
 trip verified  i wasnt going to bother reviewing this flight as i seem to be on a perpetual downer with ba but the airport experience convinced me otherwise after having our flight class reduced from first to business then offered an alternative route on the outward leg in first to make up for the disappointment they then reneged on this as it was a special anniversary it sucked flying back we checked in online to our chosen window seats at the gate we had to show our passports as we passport before boarding as we were hand luggage only trying to board we had our passports checked twice more and were issued new boarding cards for centre seats unbelievable the flight itself was very quiet and only half the normal crew for this aircraft was unavailable this meant no predeparture drinks and a limited selection of food the crew was great but what an earth is going on at ba they have this unique knack to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory every time i say this as the new club suites are great
 trip verified   i booked business class tickets for my fianc and i i had to reschedule my flight due to an unforeseen timing change so i called to get have my flight refunded the representative on the phone informed me he wasnt sure how much i would get as the refund department needed to check but estimated i would lose  of my booking to fees i accepted i never got a cancellation email or any update but instead received  total back less than  of my booking costs since then i have spent over  hours calling different departments before they blocked me ive lost a tremendous amount of money with nothing to show
 trip verified   i will never travel with british airways again i spent over  on a business class seat to attend a funeral in the uk first the boeing  cabin has  seats across the aisle so what you are getting in reality is premium economy the seats are narrow and effectively are a business class seat cut in half they have squeezed these seats in which means that some passengers bump their heads into the bulkhead when they stand up and many have to clamber over others to go to the toilet which wakes up that passenger the whole point about business class is that you pay to rest and have privacy and not have someone push over the top of you second the food was disgusting third the service terrible fourth the toilet was tiny fifth the inflight screen was fixed and too high so i could not see anything sixth their baggage handling is also appalling meaning that my taxi was waiting for  hours and i had to pay more no free airport transfers with british airways seventh the charging points did not work the second leg to london was on a larger plane with  seats across the aisle that was bearable because no hopping over people but the seat was very uncomfortable because it was not one piece this means that you are sleeping on a metal bar the seat where there is a gap in the seat to add insult to injury i now find that both flights back to sydney are on the small plane to book a seat before check in is  i paid it but note that there were only  seats left this is why i got the worst seat in the house going out this is the most appalling airline service i have ever encountered there is no point paying for business class in british airways 
 trip verified   i am already in portugal so contacted them today and they cancelled my return flight because i was  minutes late calling them even though i tried for  hours to get through the day before now i am unable to get back and they have kept the  pounds customer service is shocking they have no intention of helping you
 trip verified   terrible avoid this airline its now becoming regular practice to cancel flights had a cancellation from switzerland that forced us to spend the whole night in a cheap hotel and had to fly out the next day and then had another cancellation to spain the airline only knows how to ask for expensive prices
 trip verified   despite being a gold member the british airways staff in heathrow literally could not care in the slightest about the absolute turmoil and logistical damage or wider impact of their terrible service all the staff members repeat the same mantra  we are not obliged to provide even an update for the first  hours as if that would make the situation better there are no proactive updates no empathy no care but a lot of actual lies being told you can tell that they have given up any care or thought for the passengers as actual individuals  they show this in every action and word they say all of them are better suited to working away from other humans
not verified  regarding the aircraft and seat the business class seats on this flight were pretty good all were of the suite type where every seat has its own booth with sliding door for extra privacy the downside to this is that if you are travelling as a couple its quite difficult to interact there is ample storage and usb charging ports the seat is pretty comfortable as someone who finds it very difficult to sleep on flights this was one of the only times ive been able to get a few minutes sleep here and there the amenities provided are pretty average when compared to other airlines the leather toiletry bag was quite nice though no slippers only a pair of socks the restrooms on the flight are very small and dont provide much in the way of toiletries compared to other airlines no free wifi in business class is not acceptable another example of bas penny pinching in recent years regarding the staff and customer service poor inattentive beyond meal times there was offer of water during the flight i had to go and find an attendant and ask there was also no offer of any snacks rude at times my partner asked for a fork to be replaced as the one provided was quite clearly dirty the attendant was incredibly rude in response this left us shocked different customers seem to receive a different quality of service a customer behind me was repeatedly greeted politely by name and asked how they were whether they needed anything etc whereas my partner and i were not afforded the same level of personal service this is disappointing as we paid the same price for the tickets so expect the same level of service the food was pretty bad i had risotto while my partner had chicken both were extremely over cooked and the rice looked like porridge the vegetables were discoloured and flavourless the bread was nice though the breakfast wasnt much better summary ba has become the ryanair of long haul the customer service is way below what i would expect for a premium airline in a premium seat you pay a premium price for a very average service if there are other options available i would choose them over ba these days
not verified  i travelled with british airways from sweden to los angeles via london in december  when i arrived at lax one of my bags were missing there was no information of the whereabouts of my bag and after searching for someone for about  minutes i found the point of contact and she told me my bag was left behind i gave her my details of where i would be staying and she told me that they would contact me after a few days and still no contact i tried to call british airways customer service the woman at the airport didnt give me a file reference number so it was quite difficult to try and locate my bag but they finally found the reference number and my bag and said it would be delivered in a couple of days i told them that i had switched hotels and gave them the address for where i was staying and everything was fine but then a couple of weeks went by and my bag was still nowhere to be seen and it was time for me to fly home at the airport i tried to talk with the personnel there to try and locate my bag and they said that it was delivered to the first hotel i stayed at even though i had given them an updated address i asked them what i should to since i was flying home now the guy at the counter told me that it wasnt his problem and that i should figure it out myself i questioned him about his response and he just walked away a manager saw that and came up to me and apologized for his colleague and that they would send someone to fetch my bag and send it with either my flight or the next one i came home and a couple of days later i received my bag i made a complaint and claims on british airways website since i had to buy clothes and toiletries during my vacation because i didnt have my bag in january they said that they would refund me for my claims it is now april almost may and i have still not received the refund even after multiple email conversations i dont know what to do anymore about this situation since it appears that no one is willing to help me i am appalled about how the situation is being handled and frankly disappointed at british airways and the lack of customer service
not verified   food was lousy who ever is planning the asian hindu vegetarian meal is clueless as to what this meal includes the snack was also lousy it took us  hours just to go from t to t and clear security check the place was chaotic we get to our boarding gate and again a long line with  minutes wait for someone to check passport and boarding pass seats in premium economy was ok but when the passenger in front reclines there is very little space for the window seat passenger to cross over overall not a good airline
 trip verified  had the worst experience the flight from london to toronto got delayed and we missed the connecting flight to halifax we were four including an infant and a toddler aged  years despite being delayed and missed the connecting flight the ground staff were not at all helpful we waited for an hour to get them to talk to us and at  am they told us they have not booked any hotel for us to stay that night and asked to go search for a hotel on your own very nice of you british airways at least you guys should have given some consideration to the travelers who travel with children and booked some accommodation we will not to travel on this airline again
 trip verified   the ground staff were not helpful felt like all they wanted to do was rush us to check in and then all passengers needed up waiting in a holding area for a bus anyway travelling with a child with a disability was a nightmare with british airways logged a complaint and it took almost four weeks to answer lost some of our luggage it was not a good experience
 trip verified   second time ba premium economy in a newer aircraft and yet another excellent experience despite a three hour delay and missing my connection in hong kong this was a very pleasant flight seats are spacious and comfortable in premium economy in this layout attitude of the cabin crew was excellent and food was good they communicate well and rebooked my connection during the flight which brought peace of mind a very pleasant experience in ba premium economy after a major disappointment in club world earlier this year
not verified   they changed our flights from brussels to london heathrow to lax on  we paid extra to choose our seats since they cancelled they never honored the seat that we bought they seated us in totally different seats i asked the check in employee she was very rude and told us that we have to understand that was a different flight from london to lax was worse nobody in the airport help us employees from ba told us that we have to return next day for our flight we can rent a hotel or go terminal  and sleep there finally one employee help us and gives a voucher for hotel it was a nightmare this airline we missed one day work and ba didnt return the money that we paid for our previous chosen seats
not verified   at copenhagen the most chaotic ticket counter assignment in the history of airlines time on board never changed no fixed counter at airport abysmal service that needs vast improvement here
 trip verified   worst experience of my life trying to deal with the customer service for british airways so many issues with getting from one destination to the other had an absolutely horrible time trying to get answers or reach anyone who was capable of helping navigate uncertainties i wrote them a formal complaint requesting some type of refund and received a generic we are sorry email with  avios attached which is equivalent to maybe  on a  flight needless to say these will go to waste as i refuse to fly with an untrustworthy incompetent unorganized airline that couldnt even address one single issue expressed to them it was equivalent to handing me a band aid after slapping me in the face i will say the flight itself was smooth and the onboard staff was kind and attentive the most frustrating thing is that the customer service is trained to give you the runaround so heavily to the point of exhaustion that you just give up trying and take the loss
 trip verified   due to code sharing with cathay pacific i was downgraded to ba on my return leg i cant describe how cheated i felt i booked and paid for an airline with great entertainment food and service instead i was forced to go hungry because they only had one choice of meal and it was inedible to ensure the passengers didnt get any funny ideas and assume that as the vegetarian option was unavailable they might be given a cracker or a small packet of nuts the cabin crew announced in their uniquely aggressive and dismissive way you wont get anything else for  hours you know the entertainment is compiled mainly of b movies so i paid  for wifi so i could watch netflix on my laptop unsurprisingly the signal was so weak i couldnt even send an email to add insult to injury the earbuds provided the cheapest and lowest quality i have ever seen since the last time i used this airline the crew are less rude and obnoxious and are now just impatient and unhelpful  what i dont understand is why it seems that british airways look for these characteristics as desirable attributes for their crew 
 trip verified   lhr check in was quick at the first wing and quickly through security the first lounge was quiet for a change and a reasonably good breakfast buffet available while ba have brought back their highlife magazine in the lounge it seems they used covid to scrap all the other magazines they used to offer as part of the endless ba cost cutting the toilets in the lounge were as disgusting as ever not cleaned frequently on this visit and they are about  years out of date the public washrooms in t are better and cleaner boarding was the usual ba muddled mess and two of the gate staff appeared to have no clue what they were doing endless announcements at the gate about being a full flight requesting passengers to check in bags only to get on a flight that was less than  full onboard a very good welcome from captain and the flight left the gate only  mins late breakfast had  choices and was a fair standard no hot towels or even packet towels offered in club europe any more another part of the relentless ba cost cutting i wouldnt mind but fares are proportionately a lot higher now than pre covid cabin staff service was perfunctory at best not a scrap of recognition for ba gold or oneworld emerald members clear proof that ba really dont care any more breakfast trays cleared  mins into the flight and that was the sign for staff to stay in the front galley for the rest of the flight paid  for  hours wifi and dropped connection for the next  mins sad to note that staff service on ryanair is more pro active nowadays priority tagged suitcase came out nearly last at malaga this is standard for ba business class baggage handling do not waste your money on club europe standards just keep dropping 
 trip verified   i wouldnt recommend british airways at all i tried to call to customer service for  times in different days and time and i waited for more than  minutes on the phone i ended hanging up they are excusing themselves in the high volume of calls i write an email an i am still waiting for  weeks  website is difficult to navigate it is not easy really to have an invoice of proof of receipt or look for another service they sent you online but you dont receive a pdf file so if you need a proof of flight you need to do screenshots and once the flight is flown you have no access to that booking again to reprint any document or try to create a pdf you need to contact with a customer service which i did it online long waiting time and had to wait more than a week to receive it expensive and poor almost inexistent customer service and difficult to use their website an airline that definitely wouldnt recommend it is such a shame that in  they are still in this position and sleeping when they have competitors around
 trip verified   absolutely horrible experience i booked a ticket from expedia for a british airways operated flight from madrid to belfast with a changeover at london heathrow the whole itinerary was listed as ba although the madrid to london flight was iberia on jan nd london was experiencing cold and fog the iberian flight sat on the tarmac for  hours in madrid because of the london weather upon landing in terminal  i had to take a bus to terminal  the flight was the last flight to belfast for the evening and it had already taken off the ba desk was swamped with people as many people had to spend the night due to the weather the british airways staff said that we could go book any hotel up to  pounds and we would be reimbursed i was barely able to find a room and had to take an expensive cab however when trying to get the reimbursement ba said it wasnt their problem and that it was iberias problem iberia said they do not reimburse due to the weather when complaining to ba they said they only market the flight as ba and that they refuse to reimburse absolutely disgusting behavior by the airline to not take any responsibility for a flight that they were using their name to sell it to people but dont want to take responsibility for it did they expect me to take the bus back to terminal  their people gave out false information
not verified   this is the worst airline not one thing went right i dont understand how they have got it so bad late take off no gate when we arrived bags took over  minutes to arrive horrendous
 trip verified   i will never fly british airways again to start the plane was over  hours late with no weather and no reason given the boarding process was chaotic both in the airport and onto the plane but more importantly although we were in business class it wasnt really business class there were a few aisles not separated in any wayin which they simply put a tray on the middle seat so that no one sits there and those seats like the rest were extremely cramped and uncomfortable i could not believe they called this business class
 trip verified   worst aircraft i have ever flown the seats were cramped and uncomfortable considering the flights cost well over each we expected a little space for the money my husbands knees were rubbing on seat in front which for a  hour flight is not acceptable my food was disgusting and inedible both the hot food and the breakfast were vile i would not entertain using ba again ground staff were great its the seating and food on offer that lets the airline down we expected so much more
 trip verified   i enjoyed my flight the boarding was swift and service was very friendly and professional the food selection was good and i enjoyed the quality the was only one downside  when we landed there was an issue with ground crew not being ready at t so in total from landing to getting the doors open it took  minutes i believe the heathrow t were having strike action that week
 trip verified  why do you make it so hard after a so so lounge experience the staff taking care of boarding treated us with disdain bordering contempt it cant be training who would do that it has to be no fear of anything happening the new club world suites are a huge step up from the old product and really on deliver comfort and privacy the crew were professional but i personally found the food menu rather odd essentially there was one only main that i could handle and was then told they had ran out i was a few rows in 
 trip verified   after several delays and canceled flights we finally made it to copenhagen on american airlines and british airways flights my luggage was destroyed wheels torn off i had to buy new luggage in denmark i made a claim with british airways to reimburse me but because i didnt have the receipt for my old luggage they would only cover  of my new luggage advice have receipts for your old luggage prior to flying so you dont get ripped off like i did
not verified   literally the worst flight of my life after booking tickets together with my partner we were then separated sorry the flight is full the flight then took off  minutes late  no apology the trolley service took over two hours and they periodically skipped rows and the response was flippant and rude whoops not sure how that happened what do you want genuinely appalling from beginning to end might as well fly easy jet  at least they charge a price commensurate with the poor quality of service not like ba
 trip verified   i swore i would never fly ba again after they messed me about so much when trying to get to budapest but the times for their flights suited me so i decided to give them another go the flight left on time just about the cabin was clean and the staff friendly there was even complimentary teacoffee and a breakfast bar to be had for economy the flight was pleasant enough and i cant think of any negatives to write about the flight and service was certainly head and shoulders above my trip with easyjet
 trip verified   obviously many airlines have gone downhill in recent years prices have increased and services have gone down the most disappointing thing about ba is that aspects that really dont need to get worse have the check in staff at heathrow are downright rude and abusive shouting at passengers to line here and there and rolling their eyes if passengers get confused with the constant shouting and bullying airlines are now competing globally more and more and this behaviour is particularly noticeable in asia where the service industry is next level i wouldnt want to suggest that all the staff are like this and many younger employees are polite and helpful however there were a couple of older staff that were downright rude and obnoxious 
 trip verified  lost  out of  checked bags denied wheelchair assistance at lhr for my wife and the staff forced us to change terminals by foot rude staff on ba from lhr to ord on april   ignored multiple times when simply requested a cup of water when walked up to them after a couple of attempts to request for water politely the ba staff onboard yelled at my wife and asked her to be go back to seat horrible flight with disappointing staff customer service is terrible and online checkin never worked because ba never verified our covid documents which were uploaded in advance resulting me and my wife seated separately ive lost respect for british airways disgusted
 trip verified   i have flown with ba for many years and there was a time about  years ago when they were getting better sadly this trip underlines how they have slipped versus other airlines at booking time one is scammed an extortionate amount to book a seat at heathrow t check in the queues were unbelievably long and staff at bag drop curt to say the least the lounges here remain awful and overcrowded and ba has not invested in them for many years on the flight the food was okay although portions are kept minimal this was one of those days when the crew could not give a damn and the service was mostly absent for the entire flight next time they change ceo can they not do better than recruiting from aa second rate budget irish airline
 trip verified  boarding at mumbai was chaotic and badly organised once on board the crew announcements were professional relaxed and informative in typical ba style the seat was quite comfortable it was a refurbished aircraft and the padding and materials are quite good i was lucky that the middle seat was empty so i didnt suffer from the new narrow seat which i think would have made it a lot less comfortable the ife is excellent responsive and good quality there is an enormous selection of tv and movies and a good number of games wifi is also very good not quite netflix quality but still reasonable and i dont think  for full flight is bad value you can pay less if you just want short term simple messaging cabin crew were very good friendly and efficient catering was reasonable although on a near hr flight the small but tasty pastry for the second meal service wasnt really enough landing and processing at heathrow was astonishingly quick  it felt like it was am even though it was pm no queues or waiting at all even the baggage was super quick at coming through overall a very solid experience in economy significantly better than it used to be
not verified  mexico city airport is a zoo but taking the late departure on ba to lhr isnt too bad club passengers can use the aa admirals lounge which is surprisingly good and not too busy as it seems to cater to bas club passengers only at this time of day lovely staff solid food  bar really pleasant we flew an older  with the old style club seats seated in the front cabin just  rows of club in the window and adjecant aisle seat is really good if you travel with your partner come to think of it i will really miss this old style once cutting edge layout there is no better way to fly when you are a couple we were in that last row of the front cabin so both window and aisle seat had unobstructed access to the aisle still terrible you have to pay for these seats but it obvioulsy works and we were happy getting these seats flying ba when the crew is good is amazing service was impecable on this flight just the right mix of humor service and attention food seemed to be good as well but hardly touched it i am fine sleeping in these old club world seats although bedding could be better on time departure smooth flight and early arrival at heathrow we went outside for a smoke and returned to the terminal through fast track security at lhr has always been terrible but today security staff was too busy chatting among themselves so all bags went through without secundary checks we had a lovely shower at the spa what a fabulous facility the south lounge was crazy busy and it is just a design disaster who ever choose the bizarre combination of furniture what a mess food on offer was solid and so are the drinks our home stretch to amsterdam was pretty straight forward lousy welcome at the door but crew recovered well and made everyone feel special with excellent barcart service i love the doubleservings of drinks english tea is about the worst meal concepts in the world and i really dont understand ba stuck to it through the years noone like the cucumber white bread things but hey on time landing in amsterdam but the usual long taxi then clumsy jet bridge connection ended up with a  minute late arrival why is it so hard to connect a jetbridge in amsterdam flying club in ba is still wonderful i love it
 trip verified   very poor service very frustrating firstly my flight to lhr was cancelled on  mar while i got a text message to inform me the information desk was unable to confirm if was correct or scam once this was confirmed i went to the counter to get my new boarding pass at the counter they informed me that the coach will be leaving in mins for the hotel we me and other fellow travelers waited for over mins there was no one at the coach stand to guide us or answer any questions the transfer hotel was  mins away from the airport when we got to the hotel which is around pm the staff informed that dinner closes at  that was a rush it appeared more of a motel than an hotel the room  was smelling of weed being a nonsmoker this was uncomfortable although i wanted to compromise and rest when i went to wash my face the tap on the sink came off in my hands i panicked and asked the reception staff to change my room after some discussion they agreed to change it i went to the alternate room to my horror it was occupied i asked the staff to call a cab and i left 
not verified   generally poor sent to gate on time sat maybe  minutes was then announced as crew were not familiar with the a there would be a delay clearly nonsense and there was a retraction on board of this statement watched the crew walk through to the gate my impression was they did not want to be there was given a miniscule amount of water small bag of pretzels and then it was announced there would be a wait for any further cabin service as card processing machines were us no further updates or sight of crew for next two hours then attempted to charge us for even a glass of water when i said this should be complimentary girl said it was not her problem and walked away
not verified   ba changed our prepaid seats at the last minute and charged us to select new seats flight took off late cabin crew served a tiny packet of pretzels arrived at heathrow late put on a remote stand loaded onto buses to terminal held up at transit security by a clown of a member of staff allowed  passengers at a time because of a trial queued at security for  minutes 
not verified   flew from london heathrow to marrakech ba changed our pre paid seats at the last minute and even charged us to select other seats boarding was chaos staff were rude demanding selected passengers put their hand luggage in the hold i had one small bag however they never demanded other passengers with  bags and some with hand luggage that was obviously too big flight was late taking off and the snack was a miserable tiny packet of cheese pretzels this airline is going downhill rapidly
not verified  i was meant to fly in january to algeria i paid over  for the ticket just a few days before i was meant to fly my wife broke her foot i had to then rebook it in march and pay another  i called british airways  weeks before my flight in march and i told them again that it had to me rebooked as my wife was still not well they told me that i dont have to pay anything to get it rebooked as i sent them a letter from the hospital saying my wife wasnt well however they never sent me the ticket they made me wait for nearly  weeks and they asked me to pay either  on top of the  that i paid previously or the second option they gave me is to get a refund of  tax only i found it ridiculous that they told me to pay a fraction of the money i previously paid each time i call them they hang up on me or they continue telling me to pay  i made a complaint and nothing happened
 trip verified   we have flown repeatedly with british airways and the one world alliance over the last few weeks every flight was delayed now we are back at the airport in miami and have another massive delay so we will miss our connecting flight finally our luggage arrived in puerto rico with a day delay and we had to reschedule our round trip  we havent received any information about our luggage to this day luckily we checked it ourselves at the airport and it was there the last delayed flight meant the cabin crew that they too miss their connecting flights and we are on the same plane and they cant do anything  wir sind in den letzten wochen immer wieder mit britisch airways und dem one world zusammenschluss geflogen jeder flug war versptet nun sitzen wir wieder in miami am flughafen und haben schon wieder eine massive versptung sodass wir unseren anschlussflug verpassen werden zuletzt ist auch unser gepck mit  tagen versptung in puerto rico angekommen und wir mussten unseren rundreise umplanen wir haben bis heute noch keine info ber unser gepck erhalten zum glck haben wir selbst am flughafen nachgesehen und es war da beim letzten verpspteten flug meinte die kabinen crew dass auch sie ihre anschlussflge verpassen und wir im selben flugzeug sitzen und sie knnen nichts machen 
 trip verified   i was horrified by the extremely small seats and the poor training that the crew clearly receives not one of them exuded any kind of warmth or expressed any desire to make our journey pleasant the seats were so narrow that regardless of the size of your neighbors you are forced to touch each other constantly if the seat in front of you is reclined you have no choice but to recline your own or else you are breathing in the head scalp of the person in front of you food was revolting they dont even provide napkins unless you ask with the premeal drinks and the secondary meal the last time i flew ba it was a completely other experience and i was so sorry to see how far the quality level has slid it was really majorly disappointing and i regret that i have already purchased  other intercontinental trips with the company i will now have to see if i can change them the pathetic  ml bottle of water its just a sip on the shorter flights the seats couldnt even be reclined which was a great pity since the flight was delayed by almost  hours and we had to wait on board
" trip verified   
the worst cabin experience ever cramped seats very low cost style and uncomfortable could suit for short flights but not for a  hours service catering is also a shame ml of water  a chocolate bar for a  hours service will never fly ba again "
 trip verified  first time flying with british airways and first time flying to the americas from india via london heathrow i chose premium economy at a reasonable price i was quite comfortable however the first leg of the flight from mumbai to heathrow the plane was a bit outdated and there was only a foot rest the second leg from heathrow to nassau the plane was brand new and my premium economy seat had a pop up leg support which was much more comfortable cabin service was fine  i appreciated that they didnt come through the cabin often while everyone was sleeping the meals werent that great to be honest after landing in heathrow we had to wait on the tarmac for  minutes waiting for an open gate my connection was less than an hour long the ba staff in the heathrow airport helped me move through security quickly and i made it with time to spare for my next flight when i arrived in nassau i found that my luggage didnt make it due to the short connection time in london the ba baggage representative in nassau was extremely professional and took down my claim my luggage arrived on the next ba flight a few days later and british airways nassau representative delivered it over to a charter airline which shipped it to the island i was staying on very impressive and efficient
 trip verified   the latest affront stood in first class line for an hour finally go up front and the ba agent let  supposed vips with  large tobechecked bags in front of all of us arrogant and unapologetic add this to a long list of postcovid disappointments we are done with ba
not verified   booked a flight return flight between london and munich for  to  in december the return flight was cancelled and rebooked from  to  british airways only notified me of the first change but not the second getting the flight reinstated took multiple phone calls on both occasions each time needing to find a helpful representative british airway employees told me that even though they cancelled my flight they did not have to refund the ticket they tried to charge an  change fee through repeatedly calling back british airways reinstated my  flight on  and then again on  to make sure it did not get changed again i checked the status of my ticket daily from  to  it was intact those days on  when it was time to checkin for the flight it was gone at the airport the staff at the british airways checkin counter are not ba employees so cannot help resolve problems there are no ba representative at the munich airport the confirmation documentation from british airways was of no value i was left stranded at the airport
 trip verified   i tried to check in on line and was informed that this was not possible i was given no reason for this i telephoned ba customer service and must have wasted nearly  hours being given wrong phone numbers and incorrect information staff need customer training better knowledge of their product and some manners ba customer service was virtually non existent i will never fly with them again
 trip verified   a catalogue of failures we flew from belfast to heathrow a week ago and the flight was delayed by over three and a half hours we missed our onward air canada flight to calgary as a result on arriving in calgary after rerouting via vancouver which added over  hours to our journey we met other passengers who had also missed the same air canada flight as their british airways flight from manchester had also been delayed by several hours we are now on our way home only to find our heathrow to belfast flight which had already been cancelled and put back  hours is now delayed by another  hours avoid british airways like the plague

our flight out to dubrovnik was at the painful time of  in the morning and from london gatwick not an easy airport to get to at that hour especially as you have to be at the airport minimum hrs before to be ready to board i understand why the likes of easyjet ryanair or wizzair fly at very odd times to utilise cheaper slots at airports but it seems an odd choice for ba given most people like us who fly with them choose them based on quality not on price alone outbound lgwdbv boarding was fairly quick easy and efficient and we took off on time pilot announcements clear professional and inspired confidence which is something i appreciate and expect of ba pilots aircraft was clean and it had not been through the recent refurbishment program yet so had the advantage of having the pinnacle seats in economy still with more padding and adjustable winged headrests for better comfort complimentary harrogate mineral water given as usual which is a premium touch complimentary snack of a nutrigain bar was poor and not premium however cabin crew felt very unpolished in both presentation and behaviour  messy illfitting uniforms and unclassy makeup toilets clean and maintained appreciate antibacterial wipes being kept available postcovid inbound dbvlgw for some reason no online or app checkin available despite dubrovnik airport being a very modern airport with state of the art facilities no queue at manual checkin though and ground staff were very warm friendly and helpful proactively offered to take our larger handluggage into hold free of charge but we decided to keep with us as we would have to dash for train home from airport and trains on the other end were being cancelled already we did not understand the delay to our flight as the inbound flight for that day had took off on time and landed on time also we travelled to dubrovnik out of season and the airport was empty at that hour with all services being available solely for this flight taking off that evening all the passengers in the terminal at that time including us were there to take this flight we boarded on time and then we all sat at the gate for  minutes for no reason its truly bizarre how ba managed to take off late when all the services at the airport were operating and live solely for the purpose of enabling this flight to take off pilots for this flight were unpolished with unclear announcements  during the flight one couldnt even remember where we flying back to no apology for delay cabin crew a bit smarter presented and seemed more approachable harrogate water given out and the worlds tiniest bag of pretzels complimentary seats for this flight were horrendous and the new slimline ones ba are installing from row  onwards these seats have barely any padding so very hard and also have no headrests so very hard to get comfortable we landed  minutes late in gatwick and again no apology was given  we were lucky to catch the last uncanceled train home otherwise wed been stranded for hours wed spent half an hour circling gatwick because we missed our original landing slot given  because in the context of the shorthaul market thats what they deserve  we fly ba as we dont fly the lowcost carriers after so many bad experiences but its by no measure good just the least bad option given  point extra solely for giving something complimentary onboard"
not verified   if i could give a minus rating i would supposed to be lhrams at  on th march get to lhr at  email to say flight cancelled no one able to help at lhr said to use the app only halfway sensible option was from lcyams at  so taxi over there as trains from lhr not working ok not bas fault get to lcy showing as cancelled on screen so check the app and there it is rebook again via the app to the  departure go to desk to drop bag and was told that i was only on standby for the flight with no guarantee of a seat despite the app telling me it was confirmed the  to ams was already overbooked so was moved onto the  flight to rotterdam the  and  were both cancelled anyway as it happened eventually took off and the best thing i can say is that it landed intact return from amslhr similar story arrive at ams screen shows the  is cancelled quickly check app and confirmed it was no emails no texts nothing rebooked via app to the  departure so could have been worse desk agent helpfully printed me a boarding card as the app was unable to issue anything for a rebooked flight overall dreadful they just dont care and hide behind apps and automated call centres avoid unless you have no other option and even then stop and consider if you really need to go
 trip verified  plane was over an hour late leaving no problem that can happen but on arrival at heathrow the plane sits on the runway for  minutes as there was no free stand to go to then once at the stand we waited another  minutes as there was no bridge available to enable us to get off the plane just pathetically inefficient
not verified   we were flying world traveller plus their premium service what it was not was premium we have travelled with many airlines and lucky enough to fly premium most times bas premium is the worst i have come across the flight from heathrow to jfk was just ok the flight back was in a plane that should not be used old dirty uncomfortable with two broken seats out of the four we had one would not recline and one reclined without using the button ba needs to look at the premium service and offer exactly that instead of trying to cut costs they have fallen far behind their competitors they were once my preferred airline but now i try and avoid at all costs i would rather pay more and fly with someone else
not verified   this was literally one of the worst experiences i havent been to an airport since it began in orlando flying back the flight plan system went down and we were stuck on the tarmac for  hours poor customer service and just ignored at times then missed my connecting flight and we were told not to leave the baggage area without our bags even though i booked through to dublin another  hours i was told my bags were lost and to continue to the desk to book a flight another hour later i was handed a card with a number and told to ring it i was cut off three times and told i wouldnt be able to get home that day despite several flights being available just booked my own flight and had lost my suit and presents for christmas and missed an engagement party
 trip verified   the usual shambolic unfolding that ba has now unfortunately been come to known for we had a long weekend flight booked to munich that was supposed to be departing on th february at  this happened to be our first flight with our newborn  month old daughter it turned out to be a horror show of incompetence just under hrs before scheduled departure the original th february flight was cancelled we received an email as we were boarding the heathrow express id booked a day of holiday off work for this trip we ended up getting doing a round trip to paddington instead on the way back from the cancelled flight both me and my wife tried calling ba despite one of us having silver membership possibly the largest joke of a membership currently out there i took us nearly  minutes to speak to someone who could help i believe ba outsource their call centres and so you end up talking to people who are following a script the result is that you might as well be speaking to an ai rather than a human we often received the response similar to computer says no if this is the service level for silver members i cant imagine what a regular punter has to put up with when the phone originally connected to a person i had to wait  minutes as his computer booted up  ba then proceeded to autobook us onto a new flight for the next day but going to a different destination our original flight was to munich and the autobooked replacement flight was to salzburg when asking the robot at the ba call centre why they booked us on a replacement flight to a location km apart they couldnt understand my frustration  eventually someone was able to book us onto a flight the following day at  not ideal as id wasted a valuable day off work and the hotel wouldnt refund us or move our booking but at least we were going to munich and not salzburg  the day of the new flight came round and this time we managed to get all the way to the check in desk upon arriving at the check in desk we were told that our rebooked flight had just been cancelled  minutes earlier no email no text no notification ever arrived from ba to tell us that the flight had been cancelled incomprehensible as to how this could have possibly happened the check in person said i should get on the app to rebook at this point i didnt know whether to explode with anger or cry luckily another check in person had an ounce of sympathy and explained to the useless check in person that he could actually rebook us we were booked onto another flight later that evening   ba unfortunately that meant hrs in the grotty lounge with a  month old baby it appears that everyone now has access to a lounge and so theres really no difference between the lounge and a hostel other than you get free stuff in the former this was not a pleasant experience we did eventually arrive in munich and despite asking didnt get our push chairstroller delivered to the front of the plane the plane was a characteristically ba dumping ground  they used to give you sanitising wipes so you could clean your seat and tray table down but they seemed to have cut back on this service too all in all another shocking ba service a lost day of holiday and not an an ounce of empathysympathyunderstanding at all from any of the employees i interacted with
not verified   lost my case and took  weeks to locate it and still have not replied to me after  weeks i had a business class flight scheduled on dec    manchester  copenhagen bangkok and return flight dec    bangkok  stockholm  manchester sas airlines left manchester over an hour late due to the weather and air traffic control when i arrived in copenhagen to get the connecting flight for bangkok we were  minutes too late and the flight had gone half of the plane missed it sas airlines provided me with a new itinerary the same day being  copenhagen sas  london ba  dubai emirates  bangkok i returned from copenhagen to london and the collected my boarding pass at ba we were over  hours late leaving london due the weather and a passenger being asked to leave the flight we arrived in dubai late and was informed the flight had gone emirates then informed me that i had to speak with thai air to get another flight issued i spent over an hour phoning thai air with nobody picking up the phone i then spoke with thai air dubai who informed me that they did not have any alternative flights and suggested that i buy a new ticket and then claim the funds back later i paid  for a kuwait airways flight out of dubai  kuwaiti  bangkok whilst in dubai i checked with kuwait airlines regards my baggage and they informed me that it had not arrived from london and they would locate it and forward to my bangkok address the following day my baggage never arrived despite me completing lost baggage forms i arrived back home yesterday and was informed by ba that they have found my bag in london 
 trip verified   the incoming and outgoing flight was delayed because french air traffic controllers were on strike so we were routed over germany and not bas fault o arrival the pilot announced we could not pull onto the stand as no ground crew had showed up to turn on the automatic last metre guidance it took around  minutes to find someone then when that was done there was a further delay as there were no ground staff to operate the skybridge all told we were trapped on the plane for over an hour within metres of our gate total disruption wasted time absolutely no excuse for this
 trip verified   back in december my family and i as we were getting onto the plane were refused even though we had boarding passes and seats allocated and had booked  months in advance we were refused it turns out that someone had not turned up to work and they couldnt let all the passengers on the plane so quite randomly not  people were selected and turned away we were selected as we had no check in luggage and it was easier to boot us off despite them not knowing my circumstances if i had connecting flights in london etc i sought compensation from ba which i was told i could do and what an absolute nightmare this process has been they wouldnt acknowledge my complaint for my family until i had an authorisation letter from them saying i could act on their behalf even though i booked and paid for the tickets so i uploaded the authorisation letter no less than  times every time they told me they received it and every time i followed it up they told me they hadnt there was no other way except to post from australia to the uk to some office eventually it finally go through to them i have now chased up the reimbursement four times each time they tell me it has been sent and to be patient today they tell me that they need to check my account details so again i send them the same information that i have done before and i wait patiently for my reimbursement i am convinced that their business model is for you to get so frustrated you just go away well you know what i wont
 trip verified   as usual the flight is delayed this week it already  hours and im held on a bus waiting to get taken to the plane i really cant explain how much i detest british airways if it was a cheap budget airline i could accept it but its premium prices for the most unreliable service
 trip verified  a short ba euro trip and this is where ba excel clean aircraft good crew professional on time within lhr standards and a good value product delivered pity the in flight food sales were not a bit more exciting and appealing as more than a few asked about the non existent hot food options but good overall check in self service is great now once you know how to use it with plenty assistance on hand for those who cant
not verified   we are flying business class for most of our flight and then premium economy for the balance in addition to the plane tickets we paid an additional pp for our seats now ba is changing planes they arbitrarily put us in separate seating areas my wife  i when we were sitting together before and they want to charge one of us additional  to be reseated next to each other  they moved our seats away from each other and we shouldnt have to pay for their change of planes and their decision to not have us sitting together we havent even flown yet this airline is horrible
 trip verified   i am in australia and on friday night went online to book a flight from heathrow to malpensa milan i did not realise that when i specifically searched for flights to malpensa it offered options to other airports in milan when i received my itinerary by email it was to another airport in milan the itinerary email did not provide any means of contact for changes or advise me of the  hour cooling off period as it was the weekend here i was unable to reach their office until monday when they advised me there was no refund other than fees as i had missed the  hour cooling off period apparently as the ticket was issued in the uk i needed to contact them i have now cancelled the ticket and i will be going out of my way in the future to avoid flying british airways
 trip verified   at  am on the day of travel whilst driving to london heathrow i received an email advising my flight had been cancelled i was offered an alternative flight with american airlines which i had no alternative but to accept as i must travel today i was flying to la to see a family member who is end of life the american airlines desk downgrade my cabin from premium economy to economy tried  times ba provide telephone number total useless no help given me wrong email address for sending my complains given to me in the email i have been a ba frequent flyer for decades and have been a loyal customer i now find i am travelling  hours in economy without even the possibility of a refund let alone an upgrade this is completely unacceptable what has happened to this company i have had better treatment from ryanair
 trip verified   would happily fly them again i had a personal emergency and was allowed to reschedule my flights free of charge onboard service on lhrist was no frills but jfklhr was impeccable good food lots of moviescds on the ife open bar service the entire flight friendly flight attendants always happy to provide an extra drinksnack
not verified   flew premium only worth the extra money for the bit of extra room penny pinching means theres no other benefit  one drink service on  hour flight no fizz offered before take off poor food boarding was badly organised food left on tables  min before landing with no tea and coffee offered few small cups of water passed around but nothing premium about this new planes have been decorated terribly  feels like youre in a dentist waiting room devoid of any personality or joy only fly if the only option only fly premium if its not too expensive  seriously not worth much more than economy these days especially if youre in the middle 
 trip verified   first our morning flight was cancelled and moved to an afternoon flight understanding sometimes these situations are unavoidable however it lost us one days experience in cairo we were quite upset when we got onto the plane and were squashed into regular seats on both flights as my husband had spasms he had to stretch his legs across my lap and not once did any of the attendants ask if we were okay as we were clearly struggling as the service came to us for food each choice we made we were told they were all out and we had to settle for what they had left i did the correct thing once home and sent in my complaints they responded with a  pound voucher for our group
 trip verified   although it was a bit uncomfortable flight in an economy the flight attendants made the flight the best possibly could  such a nice and professional crew very attentive and looking out for their customers
 trip verified   boarding was decently organised the a still has the rather strange configuration in club world where you neighbour is sitting in the opposite position the a was nearly full rather poor amenity bag the welcome drink was ok but then rather long waiting for the aperitive what is made in the pantry the meal was ok but not great aside the champagne no european wines on this flight service was friendly but rather slow no spontaneous refills of drinks offered acceptable continental style breakfast extremely narrow restrooms without any lotions or similar it was an acceptable experience nothing more after landing  minutes waiting for luggage labelled as priority
 trip verified  boarding on time and departure on time for a flight to london heathrow that is very ok the a with rather narrow seats in business light meal a caesars salad a mousse as sweet and choice of drinks  nothing wrong for such a short flight fas were very friendly and landing on time
 trip verified   my original flight was cancelled just over  weeks before my actual flight and although alternative flights were available british airways affected the trip i planned it feels like ba is doing a favour to passengers rather than being paid to deliver the service
 trip verified   delayed just for a change poor communication british airways sells premium prices flight tickets and delivers no better than a low cost airline customer service is impossible to contact and it seems ba tries hard to hide any possible email communication address when its available
 trip verified   very competent check in staff saw had a problem with my left arm and insisted i could not take exit seat moved me to row  where the middle seat was empty on the other hand on board  huge line for toilets   min into a  min flight a crew member realised one of the toilets is closed  as crew had put their luggage there they announced that they could not serve hot drinks on this flight and to bear with them as service will be slow on asking why they did not give us enough cups for hot drinks and the card machine is not working so we have to fill out each credit card slip a bottle of water and a nutrigrain bar 
 trip verified   check in was so slow no self check in and bag drop boarding was ok flight totally full booked row  which was ok some space in overhead bins seat and legroom ok cabin crew ok smiled gave out the bottle of water and pretzels flight itself was ok landed  mins early and then waited  minutes for a stand and ground crew bags came off reasonably quickly ba still seems to believe it is something special a premium carrier the reality is that it is not the only reason we flew ba was we got virtually free tickets because both flights were cancelled last year ba is our carrier of last choice
 trip verified   my review relates to the appalling experiences i had with british airways on th february  i was due to travel to madrid with british airways and before setting off i heard on the radio that there were flight delays i looked at the heathrow airport website and saw that my flight had been cancelled as a result of the information on the website i called british airways and have  minutes on hold i found myself speaking to somebody in a call centre in south africa the person was hard to understand due to a heavy accent and he was incompetent and insisted that the flight was not cancelled i made my way to heathrow and sure enough the flight was indeed cancelled the woman in question had the audacity to declare that the flight was cancelled and that there are no facilities here at the airport to rebook you she refused to let me and about  other people join the queue for the clearly marked assistance desk the same woman and one of her colleagues gave out a card with a telephone number and told one rather elderly gentleman to go online to rebook your seat i am visually impaired and found the attitude of the ba employee to be appalling i called the number on the card the employee gave me and was again in a long queue to a call centre the person who picked up the phone kept me waiting  minutes and declared that the flight was not cancelled and that the airport must be wrong he then in a flippant tone said he was just informed that the flight was indeed cancelled and that i would have to go and speak to iberia customer services in heathrow to rebook i took the elderly gentleman with me to iberia where the counter staff member rolled her eyes in disgust and said that it was nothing to do with iberia i returned to ba and this time i joined the checkin line and told a checkin agent what had happened the man in question booked me onto the next available flight within a matter of a few minutes he gave me a  voucher as a form of compensation but said he could not add my frequent flyer number with a partner airline the voucher proved useless i am afraid as various shops in the predepature area refused to accept it and although i was told i could use it after clearing security none of the shops would accept it once aboard my new flight the service was minimal other than a tiny bottle of water and a packet of pretzels nothing else was available this was a full flight as so many people had been transferred from the cancelled flight ba cabin crew announced that any additional items other than the small bottle of water and pretzels had to be ordered via their skyshop
 trip verified  this was my first time flying with ba  i was pleasantly surprised islamabad via doha was very comfortable and the crew were great friendly and helpful the second flight was operated by qatar airways this was from doha to islamabad my return journey was a direct ba flight kg luggage allowance was really generous and stopped the hassle with connecting flights crew on this flight were really nice too what let ba down was the food it really was not nice the ife could do with some more content but thats not really a huge issue
 trip verified   lots of cancellations and delays and no one apologized edinburgh to london on feb th  our original flight was cancelled and the rebooked one was cancelled as well the third rebooked one was supposed to departure at  and had several delays until  then we had to wait  minutes for our luggage to arrive
 trip verified  ba  on the  boarding was delayed due to late arrival from the incoming flight communication from the ground staff was excellent and keep us informed in flight services were excellent the crews were friendly with excellent service overall very happy with ba
 trip verified   not only my first flight in  years but also my first time back to england for  years i flew from pmilgw on  and returned on  both wizz air and easyjet offered very inconvenient flight times and charged more than the flights were worth for baggage british airways were the most convenient and best value option available they offered ideal flight times and the  charge per flight for baggage was very reasonable  total cost for both flights was   regular update information via email seamless online seat allocation and check in efficient staff at the check in desks at pmi and lgw ensured that long queues were dealt with as quickly as humanly possible immaculate aircraft comfortable leather seats with adequate legroom im  tall cabin crew were polite friendly and professional in flight food and drinks were good quality and reasonably priced i enjoyed the meat ploughmans and ipa beer   total on both flights i have flown  times in the last  years with different airlines on various propeller and jet aircraft as well as one lgwlhr helicopter transfer flying was a totally different experience back in the day we are now in the age of the budget airline nostalgia aside british airways are the best airline ive flown with
 trip verified   my husband and myself were flying to madrid on the rd of february for a legal matter and we had to be in madrid by  pm we had booked our flight and car with ba holidays unfortunately we chose a parking we had never used before we got lost and missed our  am flight to madrid i tried to stay calm cold head and we went to british airways to get help the first lady that we spoke to asked if we had done the booking with ba holidays we didnt know that she gave us a number to call and told us that she couldnt do anything else that we had to call that number we called the number which was asking us to call another  number which we did and there the message was that opening hours were from  am till  pm we went back to the lady and explained that we couldnt wait until  am but she told us that she could not do anything i did reach out to another staff  a lovely young lady called althea she started to look at it made several calls went to check with someone else to an office she managed to get someone to send me a text message that i had to call and that got answered and the other lovely lady on the line modified our booking to place us in the following flight at  am they didnt charge us for that our car reservation and flight back were maintained and we made it to madrid without the support of the lovely althea her professionalism her care for us we would not have make it she was so sweet so caring but at the same time so determined to help she for sure went above and beyond her role and her responsibilities
 trip verified  organised boarding process really friendly crew quick drink and a snack all in all a great experience the crew are a credit to ba the best crew in europe
 trip verified   outward journey ba london to buenos aires club world  january  our experience was poor from beginning to end although we had reserved seats f and j another passenger was occupying f and crew made no attempt to address the problem eventually i persuaded the passenger to move and occupy her designated seat d we boarded punctually but were not offered drinks when i asked for a drink the crew member said it was too late and blamed the seating problem the same crew member then began taking orders for dinner but did not write them all down and gave up after a few minutes for the safety briefing she asked us to repeat our orders later the hot flannels smelled musty and felt old and ragged  one of the crew wondered aloud whether my companion and i were related  my soup was cold i was told it was served from flasks was that an explanation or an excuse my coffee was weak and tasted like instant granules my companion was initially served no bread roll with dinner the breakfast menu stated a selection of rollspastries but there was no choice and my companion was given a dried fruit pastry where he would have chosen a bread roll  although we had not previously asked for or been offered any other than those supplied at the seat small bottles of water ran out return journey ba buenos aires to london heathrow world traveller plus  january  was a huge contrast from the warm welcome on boarding to crews professionalism throughout its a poor reflection on club world service that our experience in world traveller plus was so much better and kinder weighed against the advantages of a flat bed the considerable price difference was not worth paying for the catalogue of errors and inconveniences outlined above
 trip verified  check in agent at lhr was very helpful and friendly as were the in flight crew seat was comfortable with good leg room however the food was poor  barely better than economy class with a poor quality and limited selection of wine in flight entertainment selections were very limited far inferior to what ba used to offer overall this premium economy product was disappointing and very poor value for money
 trip verified   very disappointing i book ba so i can fly during the day my return flight at pm on  was cancelled replaced by a flight at pm it took off  hour late meaning i arrived at gatwick well after midnight with no onward transport connections i had to pay  for a taxi home plus the seats are really snug im only  but my knees were hitting the seat in front no more ba for me they are trading on their name but the customer service and reliability has deteriorated ryanair has better aircraft and takeoff slots
 trip verified  excellent service both on the ground and on board  while their first class product might not be leading edge the service around the entire experience was well worth the cost of the ticket the concorde room at heathrow is well managed and a great place to relax prior to the trip flight was slightly delayed out of heathrow but arrived on schedule in johannesburg
 trip verified   good lounge at cape town on time departure drinks high quality sound dinner service breakfast reasonable arrival lounge was good but showers cold
 trip verified   a really excellent journey lounge not overcrowded in late afternoon plenty of edible food easy boarding new club world suites great and compared to when we last travelled in them a year ago food and drink back to previous standards choice of individual wines rather than bland blends courses served individually with cut glass and china beef cheek really tasty as was a surprisingly good soup crew excellent good choice of movies breakfast after a good nights sleep fruits etc first couldnt manage the full english which was offered arrival on time what more could you want not quite up to gulf standards overall but ba seems to have eventually got its business class back to standard
 trip verified   this flight was one of the worst i have ever had in my life i wanted to pamper myself so i bought business class i was looking forward to my new experience i will not mention the chaos of changing gates several times as these things may happen what surprised me was the lack of attention to passengers the flight was delayed by almost  hours even though staff offered vouchers we had no idea where to get them and we were told that we only had about  minutes to use them because boarding had already begun firstly i did not see anyone with the voucher and secondly even if we got it we were not able to use it when i finally got to the airport there was another waiting for about  minutes after cross check meantime we were told that due to problems they did not load any food so the flight will be without any food on board the only food offered and given to everyone on the plane was a small bag of nuts as a business class passenger i was offered drinks only all in all my business class contained  small glasses of juice   i received no apology or compensation from the company at all it was a disgraceful and cheap service for a very expensive price 
not verified  it seems that there is a race to the bottom amongst airlines i cannot even check in because ba requires the submission of documents for covid restrictions however the form to start the submission process is hopelessly broken after clicking submit the form just hangs forever no error message is given i tried three different browsers on three different devices all have the same hang which means you cannot check in online nor can you select a seat i tried using the chat bot but after  minutes of clicking try again i thought i had donated enough time to ba 
not verified   as a spanish born individual living in england i have been using british airways for over  decades multiple times a year on th january  i booked a flight for my son and i to go to alicante however i was informed on the th january  by my doctors that i am unable to fly due to an elbow operation i have had as a result i decided to give my ticket to my daughter calling up the customer service team for british airways to make the change on the th january  they took my enquiry call there seemed to be some speech delay in the call which presented a small bit of difficulty however i also struggled to understand the support staff member on top of this delay when requesting to change the name on one of the tickets to my daughters name i was told this is not within the policy and that i would need to cancel the ticket and rebook it i was encouraged to divide the booking so myself and my son were on two different booking reference numbers i accepted this and was then asked if i would like to cancel the booking i insisted i would need to know the total of the refund its lucky i did ask to check this as i was then informed it would be roughly  the total cost of my booking was  which comes to  per passenger leaving my refund total at less than  of the value of my purchase this is despite the seat not be abandoned according to ba  policy all i am entitled to out of a simple change of name is less than  refund even when im buying the ticket right back then and there on the phone probably for more money than it was worth a week ago
 trip verified   a rather empty and quiet flight to tel aviv very friendly cabin crew and due to the emptiness of the flight i had an entire row to myself which allowed me to work easily and have as much space as required unfortunately upon landing the breaks overheated and we had to wait for the fire crew to cool them down which delayed us otherwise an overall excellent flight on bas part this was the first time i have flown this flight and it has actually taken off at the correct time
 trip verified   easy check in and staff member was polite and helpful and made a specific point of acknowledging our loyalty to ba security at london was fast galleries north was fine and showers were good organised flight boarding plane was fine with good crew and new club world product my wife had a damaged storage area but otherwise ok after take off there was a good drinks and food service which was well run slept well on time arrival we both found the new seat design harder to sleep in
 trip verified   being a silver flyer and booking a flight through ba to dublin you would have thought i could use the lounge even though ba used air lingus for the flight travelled recently there with the same situation and was allowed in by a kind gentleman at the desk even though he said i had to be gold  he was really accommodating and it wasnt a big deal but the two ladies on the desk were like no no empathy there at allsaying the other guy shouldnt have let me and they will have a word with him  come on ba i booked the flight through you and you made me fly with air lingus so you should let me use the lounge as a silver flier 
not verified   i find ba incredibly tacky and constantly looking for ways to get money out of customers i have travelled using major airlines my whole life and although i know it sounds silly  when on a  hour flight on a major airline you do expect some form of beverage or snack as a curtesy and a port to charge your phone and not have to pay insane prices for luggage there was no inflight entertainment and the aircraft was very snug when i challenged why i had to pay for my own drink and why no inflight entertainment  i was told it was a short haul fight my sisters met me from cairo which is an hour and half flight and flew egyptair and somehow received luggage allowance drinks food and inflight entertainment as well as a usb port to charge their phones ba i now realise stands for budget airline staff were great  what you got for your money not so much
 trip verified   flew atl to lhr th jan  was unlucky enough to be on board a  year old  refit gave it a decent ife screen and the seat looked decent although combine the ife with the cheap and nasty earbuds and any movie can be ruined headrest was great just a pity little padding is used on the seat as my wife and i were very uncomfortable the leg room in general is poor especially when passengers keep their seat reclined from start to finish zero room aircraft was tired rubber spacers falling out silicone sealer falling apart in the toilets toilet seats old stained rubber on arm rest was hanging off no post take off drinkssnacks offered  meal was sent out after a couple of hours was poor chicken cubes that reminded me of dog food mashed potatoes that were purified within an inch of their life stale rock hard roll salad which was rice and carrots dried crackers with no cheese kids meal was just as sad tiny leaf salad with enough dressing to refloat a shipwreck coffee creamer was given with the kids meal snack was decent for the adults bagel with cheese and egg hot and tasty kids snack was a green wrap with spinach and onions in it  very very poor mix the food ba service with a grunt being crammed into a seat for  hours landing at a remote stand and enduring a bus to the terminal and ba in my opinion is terrible this flight was so disappointing other than one great member of cabin crew everything else was just average
"not verified   great thing about british airways a is the economy section upstairs get this if you can as it allows you to have small stowage cupboards at the window seats despite being not very old the a looked tired inside broken side stowage a seat that reclined uncontrollably and slow to react ife the food was supposed to be christmas dinner  wafer thin bits of dry turkey  over cooked sprouts and some cubed potatoes poor in taste and quality mousse desert was great though slight issue during the snack meal ordered a childs option which was marked as such regular meal arrived as well and they were exactly the same asked a crew member to be told the difference was the sticker on the box staff were ok couple decent but mostly just ok overall ba just seems a tad cheap these days great to sit upstairs but that was where the enjoyment ended just seemed a bit dull and like ba are just an average airline

not verified  the staff are friendly the plane was cold we were shivering they gave light blankets but they were not enough meals were basic entertainment was basic luggage is delayed today is day  and ba staff over the phone say call after  hours tracking system is very vague had to extract information from staff that they arrived to vancouver on jan nd i offered to collect baggage but very vague answer call the airport asked her for ba phone number at yvr but she said we dont have a phone number for you to call call the main airport their policy states you can make a claim only after  days
 trip verified  probably the worst business class experience ive ever had on an airline just a few of the issues required to purchase seats on international club world business class this was not made known during the ticket purchase process and cost me an additional  on a single leg lhrlax for a family of four given the very strange business class seating layout on ba as leaving the seat selection to change could have been disastrous for my family ridiculously long boarding times on even small aircraft on my vielhr leg the boarding time for the a was over  minutes long leading to a delayed departure there was no urgency on the part of staff to speed up the boarding times severe overcrowding in the boarding area in satellite c of terminal  at heathrow boarding staff would not allow passengers to enter the roped off queue area before boarding i have no idea why not and so crowding was extreme the overall boarding area was far too small for an a and i believe this satellite was designed and built after the first as were delivered online checkin in advance of flights appears to be completely broken i was urged repeatedly on the ba website and via email and text to upload my covid documents even though at the end of  there are no covid documents required for travel after i filled in basic contact information on the website  and did not upload any covid documentation  i was informed several hours later that my covid documents have been verified i then received another text message urging me to upload my covid documentation on the vielhr leg the shopbacom page that one is directed to after attempting to connect to wifi on the plane indicated ridiculously incorrect remaining flight times  over six hours and then four hours just before landing ba lounges for club europe and club world at heathrow are often seriously overcrowded furniture and carpeting and other finishes in the clubs are worn or dirty that said the food in the lounges was of pretty good quality the food quality in ba lounges at heathrow may be the only redeeming thing about this airline onboard food and beverage service was far below average for international business class terrible one might say on the lhrlax leg there was no premeal beverage service and there were no midflight beverage services at all unlike most business class offerings on other airlines there was no taking a meal order by flight attendants at the beginning of the flight meals were brought out haphazardly shortly after take off with the chicken or fish type of meal selection similar to economy class there was no coffee or tea service after meals food quality was poor with the prelanding snack of a ploughmans lunch being downright disgusting  there was no beverage or bar setup in the galley areas  beverages available to passengers during the flight  as is standard on most international business class offerings even bottles of water seemed be hidden away requiring one to ask the flight attendants for water i wont comment on the bizarre seating layout on the a as others have rightly panned the awkwardness and extremely poor design of the seating the seats are not   long as stated on the ba website and i found the seats too short for my   height the priority luggage tags were not followed in the baggage delivery
 trip verified  definitely not recommended especially for business class the seats are ridiculous and small the food is mediocre if that and good luck with the internet even if you pay for full internet for the entire flight the service however has been great my attendant saved me from crying i dont know who designed this aircraft but in this expensive business class in order to move out of you middle seat to go to the bathroom you must rudely climb over the persons legs sitting in the aisle seat your seat is like an enclosed tiny cubicle with no storage space ive unfortunately traveled british airways business class at least  times within the last  months never again unless there is no other choice by the way the business class lounge south at heathrow is a cattle pen
 trip verified   ba shuttle service across the uk is still surprisingly a good product when compared with ba long haul that doesnt always get the best of comments at times its reasonable priced works well fresh crews and no queues or long distances to walk i dont know why they still offer a covid style bottle of water and snack when just stretching to a cup of tea and snack would be great add on for this service currently they have an on line sky cafe but its too fiddly to work or get connected in short trips
 trip verified  i must admit like many others i tend to avoid ba long haul where possible due to the many poor reviews but had my first ride on a ba a the other day so it was an exception what can i say aircraft immaculate and economy seat really comfortable but thats about it ife didnt work but wasnt that interesting anyway i got the map screenshot for a while lunch was poor quality but plenty of nice white wine and other alcoholic drinks made up for it cabin crew pleasant but poor grooming lets them down some skirts some trouser suits some long sleeves some short some jackets some waistcoat some cardigans on at time and all in all they could have done better i think baggage delivery was really quick summing up well i am still not coming back to ba not yet maybe the old charm will return soon
not verified   when will ba update their business class cabin   across on a  it is not so much travelling facing backwards as it were but the cabin staff having to pass food trays across the front of passengers paying business class fares as for having to pay to reserve a specific seat  an antiquated idea the cabin staff were fine food acceptable checkin ok and business lounge breakfast acceptable the lack of space in the seating area small screen and disfunctional entertainment equipment disappointing having to step over the reclining passengers feet is not attractive 
 trip verified   paid  day before flight for an upgrade from economy to premium economy at checkin they could not find my booking so a little wait while they rang someone who explains on the upgrade you get deleted from the system the checkin agent sees took about  minutes to resolve seat was nice enough stowage pocket in front a bit small food was reasonably nice shame that the bathroom is all the way back through economy and there is a bit of a queue ife system is good but selection mediocre worst part of the flight is that at cpt so we were on a remote stand and bussed in through passport control quickly but then it took an absolute age to get our luggage which ruined what would otherwise have been a reasonable flight upgrade was worth it at  maybe  its a long flight but their offers of  or whatever for premium economy is comedy pricing score before the luggage fiasco would have been  or    with the luggage fiasco i cant rate it more than 
 trip verified   ba website did not work weirdly deleted my flight from upcoming flights on the day of departure chaos at cape town airport with hundreds queuing as the computers were down chaos at the gate  no queue management for premium passengers very nice new a with smart new club suite champagne warm cabin crew said its impossible to serve it cold which is not true as air france manage it disappointing meal wine served so late after the food you have finished by the time it arrives cheese ice cold and tasteless why cant the champagne  white wine be in the fridge used for the cheese good ife system but mediocre film selection disappointing breakfast overall    flew air france business the month before which was way better so sad whats become of ba
 trip verified   absolutely terrible experience with british airways after a short flight from london heathrow to frankfurt they couldnt get my suitcase to me in time for my next flight on cathay pacific to melbourne despite a  hour gap between the two flights told me they would arrange for the suitcase to be transferred directly to melbourne  instead it got to hong kong and left there when they finally tracked it down they sent it back to london all happened over christmas so very stressful yet minimal communication from their team while the plane crew may be lovely the service outside of this has been nothing short of dreadful and if given the option i will avoid flying with them in future
 trip verified   vancouver to delhi via london we were booked to fly from vancouver to new delhi via london heathrow on dec nd we received an email on dec th informing us about the industrial action in the uk i called to find out how it may impact our travel the representative kind of scared us of being possibly stranded during our travel and offered us a full refund we called again to confirm about other options but he did not offer any other solutions we asked to cancel our tickets and he told us about the cancellation fee we booked new tickets with another airline with double the cost as our trip was urgent simultaneously he told us he no longer can cancel our tickets on the system but promised us he will make it happen because he told us we would get a full refund he processed the cancellation  hours later he emailed us that the tickets couldnt be cancelled and suggested we cancel our new tickets once he found out they were with another airline we lost  from cancelling the new tickets now the representative claimed that he never said there wont be any services available and asked us why we were worrying about the industrial action and that other arrangements will be made if there were any issues this was new information never given to us before we kept our british airway tickets the next day we asked to speak with the manager and report that we were misguided about the whole situation we never heard back from the manager as we logged in to checkin  hours before take off we found that our van  lhr flight was cancelled due to the bad weather in vancouver we did not receive any emails from the airport nor the airline about this change we called ba again and asked about rearrangements for our flight to which they offered rebooking with an additional  per person price difference and the dates offered were about  days after our original flight was supposed to leave additionally to cancel the rest of the flights with them which we could not reach since our first flight was cancelled we had to pay about  cancellation fee to get a refund we were very frustrated with the overall experience and no accommodations nor accountability as they wanted to charge us for any service or changes possible we were on the phone for  hours while other flights that we could have booked were getting sold out  the customer service person would take  minutes for real to search up each question or option we asked about it has been a frustrating experience  we lost time and money and it ruined our holidays completely we then demanded to speak to the manager who again did not want to take any accountability for their team and gave us a small discount on the cancellation fee in total we were on the phone with them for  days back and forth without any resolutions we felt misguided and misinformed with their unfair policies towards their customers we did not feel taken care of at all we had to pay the price for the misinformation and the flights we did not cancel ourselves after all this trouble we spent christmas without our family and the missed the urgent reasons we were travelling for 
 trip verified   old a with narrow pitch flight perfectly on time with constant announcements from cockpit friendly staff free chips and water quick luggage delivery at t
 trip verified   another ba shambles started off well with excellent check in at first at t mid afternoon so avoided the early morning evening scrum into the concorde lounge excellent service again great choice of cocktails wine etc food ok a bit overcooked but pretty reasonable called to the boarding gate chaos people jostling for position to get on the plane people with children under  called before the  people in first bankrolling the flight and most of them well over  we get on to be told that none of the lights in first can be dimmed at all so the lights were on all night it was like being detained and interrogated excellent wine and champagne selection dinner menu handed out ill have the prawn cocktail to start please no you wont as theyve only loaded one for  people and the guy in a got it i bet he felt like hed won the lottery ok ill have the beef wellington basically a freezing slice of beef with some lettuce mains  ill have the curry no you wont as theyve substituted that with christmas dinner  im going to the maldives to get away from christmas i ended up with short ribs that were inedible no salad starter no water offered no bread roll i just couldnt eat it so basically my husband and i have spent  on  return seats to be blinded by lights on and left starving no apologies watch out ba as virgin start flying direct in october as always you rest on your laurels and treat your customers like idiots
not verified   ba cancelled my flight home to heathrow on dec th on the face of it that was sensible as the weather in iceland was appalling however what was not acceptable was that the flight was cancelled only  hours before take off time by which time i was already struggling through dreadful driving conditions to get to the airport i got nowhere near before the conditions became too bad if they had taken advice they would have spared everyone the need to try and travel on roads that all ended up closed i am now booked onto the flight on the st and downgraded for my sins having checked today as i type they have not cancelled the flight on the th despite the road to keflavk being closed do they not check these things any help from ba offered  not really
not verified   ba cancelled my flight home the last flight of the day into heathrow and tried to push me onto another flight to london city  hours later my car was at heathrow i didnt want to try and cross london late at night on public transport with luggage especially as there were rail strikes announced around that time i had to book a flight home with lufthansa which cost  for an economy seat but at least it got me home to heathrow all be it another terminal on the friday night so i could get home to family i still have had no news on a refund of the   months on its such a shame flying ba used to be such a pleasurable experience ba have cancelled or moved one leg of every journey weve booked this year we are regrettably have to use other airlines now which have much better reliability and customer service
 trip verified  turned up  hours in advance terminal  at london heathrow was already carnage s of people trying to check in only  desks manned long queues at security due to only  lines open people stressed pushing shouting and flight delayed by  hours according to pilot delay due to suitcases all needing to be loaded missed connecting flight in doha  hours wait til next one received a voucher approx  for the whole day arrived  day later my suitcase didnt arrive with me filed a claim at the desk for  days no update no information no offer of compensation and no solution offer i now have a spoilt holiday many personal belongings are gone xmas gifts missing extensive expenses i dont know if i will be reimbursed beware with ba expect low level or zero customer service old planes and zero help if anything goes wrong or missing i will personally avoid ba in future at all costs
not verified   boarding  at gate at lgw they called group  to board we were world traveller plus  group  then called anyone in groups  whereupon everyone else surged forward why have numbered boarding groups if you dont use them cabin crew  treated passengers as an inconvenience as they moved about the plane at one point a passenger was coming out of the toilet as a crew member approached and the crew member just pushed the door closed pushing them back into the toilet as they went past and without even a word no acknowledgement when you stood aside to let them past service  we were in the final row of six in wt which has a total of  seats the lunch meal was brought out and we were the last people to be served not unusual for back row seats but when it came to us there was only the vegetarian option left of the  menu options cabin steward said that they had only been given  wt meals there was a second hot meal served before we landed again the same server got to us last and again there was only a vegetarian option left i asked if it might not have been possible to commence serving this second meal from back to front so that we had a choice for at least one meal and she said she hadnt thought of that food  some of it was inedible vegetarian cannelloni had pasta so thick and uncooked neither of us could eat it the bread roll was crispy like toast in the bottom half and soft in the top half only thing i could eat was the baby bel in between meal snacks consisted of a  biscuit pack of shortbread pretty basic drinks  they ran out of red wine  hours into an hour flight toilets  there was no toilet accessible directly from the wt section we had to walk halfway down the plane through economy to reach a shared toilet we flew virgin atlantic  months before in equivalent premium economy and it was so much better organised boarding sparkling wine or orange on boarding water or orange in ba food options available even in last row seats better food proper glassescups for drinks dedicated toilet access help yourself snacks helpful service from cabin crew we will not be looking to fly ba over virgin in future
 trip verified   missing baggage customer service was the worst ive ever experienced i arrived back in phoenix on sunday evening and air tags showed my bags arrived on monday but it took three more days before they were finally delivered i understood that due to delays caused by freezing fog in london my luggage did not make it onto my final flight i filled out the required form at the phoenix airport and then attempted to fill one out online where i received a message saying that the bags had already been reported missing and to enter the tracking code that had been sent to me via email but no email was received i made phone calls daily and was told a message was sent and i should hear back within  hours finally the email with the tracking number was received on tuesday night i went online with the tracking number on wednesday and it requested that i provide the same information that i had given them on the form at the airport my luggage was finally delivered on thursday afternoon 
 trip verified   british airways are not the flag carrier they used to be the checkin staff at the club europe area did not display any premium service and did not provide a good overall service  the galleries south lounge was very busy but the food was very good there is a good array of salads pasta bread and hot food available the festive turkey and ham pie was particularly good the flight was delayed as lhr was very busy on a tuesday evening the boarding process was stressful due to the lack of any queue management system and the majority of passengers congregating around the gate despite ba using a group system to board it took almost hr to board  passengers the flight itself was good with a good club meal service the bar service was good but it seems that ba have done away with champagne onboard and also in the lounge a menu is handed out prior to departure with a good food offering for the length of flight the food was very good with beef cheek served with vegetables being chosen ba have always excelled with their catering and this has not changed the seat is a standard economy seat with a table in the middle seat for club europe a standard practice for ba the seat was comfortable but with limited leg room the cabin was clean presentable and tidy with no issues the a featured wifi which contains a very good landing page with flight information access to the speedbird cafe menu access to bacom and a good pricing strategy for wither just messaging or streaming also overall the airline is still a good world player but with clear improvements needed with their ground staff the cabin manager was very good but the other crew in club did not display the expected behaviours in business class she kept touching her face not making eye contact with passengers and seemed uninterested and like she did not want to be there
 trip verified   stupidly tried ba again after a five year gap and paid over  for my wife and i to go to barbados because i thought the new business class layout might rival virgin atlantic on the route about six months ago ba announced they were switching planes to the old antique pushmepullyou layout but it was too late to reorganise our holiday logistics sure enough we suffered the most appallingly uncomfortable flights with no room eight seats across worn out fittings inedible food and surly fas
not verified   seat horribly narrow  on a  thankfully the flight was only a quarter full so was able to stretch out food and beverage service was good and it was great having a proper beer not a cup of froth that overflows cabin crew very good booked as a ba ticket that included travel on qatar airways as well
 trip verified   glasgow to london delayed by  hour my wife and i now accept that a ba flight will be late and delayed very rarely on time as long as you accept this you wont be disappointed planning ahead theres a high risk of delays if you are connecting with another airline with oneworld its extremely risky
 trip verified   when i tried to check in online i was offered an upgrade to premium economy for just under  i decided to take it but then the website wouldnt allow me to choose seats or to check in i phoned ba and was happy that the call was picked up quickly but i was then told that because i had changed my booking i had to check in at the airport so we turned up three hours before the flight only to be told that our two adjacent aisle seats in economy had been switched to the middle seats in a row of four in premium the checkin agent was helpful but couldnt fix and suggested we try the ba desk airside that desk was understaffed but when we did reach the front of the line we were told to try at the boarding gate at the gate we finally managed to get one aisle seat and one window not sitting together after going through that the flight was surprisingly good with decent food and very good service we flew back economy which wasnt too bad either the flight attendants were friendly and enthusiastic and emma and daniel who looked after us could not have been better ive obviously learned my lesson about late ba upgrades but everything else was good
 trip verified   i flew from prague to lhr excellent service attentive staff first drink service then meal service choice of three meals later second drink service in reality  excellent flight couple of days later i flew back from lhr to prague boarding at lhr t was a total chaos onboard service cannot really be called service no curtain between business and economy class which later caused people endlessly passing to get to the toilet meal service could not get more unprofessional   rows took two guys nearly  mins to serve constantly interrupted no people passing to the toilets at this time yet i dont know if there was any meal choice as no one bothers talking to you i was served that  afternoon tea consisting of three canapeslike bites and some drink why would we bother serving you also a scone hardly after  mins plates to be taken away  when i asked for my scone it came as a surprise i was not served any no coordination between the crew  crew busy chatting at the galley in reality  the service could not get any worse one just must ask what do you pay the premium price for 
 trip verified   disappointing again especially on business the service is ancient one world lounges are a catastrophe at heathrow business class seat is similar to economy and electronics are very poor onboard 
 trip verified   during both the outbound and return flights we were not offered a decent meal we received a tiny bag of chips and a very small bottle of water what outraged us the most is that during the return flight we couldnt even order any food  drink because the card reader didnt function the first and last time well fly with ba
 trip verified   i was flying to warsaw for one day of meetings and would be flying back out to miami the next day initially my flight was delayed in denver by  hours as such i knew i would miss my connection in warsaw the denver to heathrow flight was terrible the plane was dirty i was in economy i usually fly business or premium economy but on this flight there was no availability the plane was only about  full and the service was not good my food was inedible and the seats very cramped although the middle seat was open so that made it tolerable when i arrived in heathrow it was a complete circus passengers everywhere trying to rebook missed connections not only my flight but multiple other flights had missed connections after waiting in line for an hour i was finally rebooked on another ba flight to warsaw this plane was the smallest x plane i have seen packed in like sardines my bag never showed up so i had to cancel my meeting and now have no bag to fly back to miami ba has shown no desire to help other than to give me standard answers and that hopefully my bag will show up in miami at some point and i can retrieve it from there i mean the bag is sitting in heathrow somewhere with  different fight options to get it to warsaw yet ba in unwilling to do anything to expedite getting my bag to warsaw before i leave for miami the next day 
 trip verified   booked a ba holiday to marrakech after posting a negative review regarding my double tier points credit i can now confirm that the points have been credited it took a while but ba did eventually make good on their promise thank you based on things now being resolved i have travelled on ba since and i am booked to travel to south africa in first class on nd january looking forward to the new ba concorde lounge keep it up ba loyalty is indeed a way street
 trip verified  extremely subpar service highlights no online meal selection staff pretty much dropped off whatever meal they had and were very rude if a passenger wanted it changed last meal was delayed to the last  minutes of flight plates were literally grabbed away i had to hand over my unfinished plate that the staff again dropped on me no apology no offer of a napkin i had to scrounge for a piece of paper to clean my jacket none of the passengers were told to straighten up their seats before meal because the seat before me was so tilted i could barely keep the plate on the tray without things slipping off staff walked down with some water and biscuits this got exhausted just before she got to me she just looked at me and walked away nothing further was offered
 trip verified   i virtually gave up on british airways about three years ago writing off my avios and opting for other airlines but my return flights from heathrow to lisbon this week were very good the aircraft were pretty much full but the service was excellent and the food surprisingly good a particular shoutout to a flight attendant called jo but all the teams there and back were enthusiastic and attentive im going to have to start spending those avios
 trip verified   i was pleasantly surprised that the airline could maintain a steady schedule with little delay considering the time of the year and the weather the flight from montreal was my return flight to scotland but i originally booked to fly to and from toronto but the airline helped me cancel and i rebooked for a cheaper flight the inflight service was pretty decent andthey do offer a blanket and pillow as well they walk through the cabin offering drinks and handing out a small snack prior to the leading meal service while the food was typical air plane food i thoroughly enjoyed my flight and had no issues at all with my flights
 trip verified   british airways is late their website is atrocious and they wouldnt let me checkin until  hours before the flight i have been trying for  hours to check in through their website andor find a real person to speak with customer service had such a thick accent i didnt think they were speaking english 
 trip verified  flew from amman to london on nov   not sure what type of aircraft it was my ticket was economy plus the flight is hm we received exactly ml of water and about  potato chips the seats did not recline and there was no entertainment system any other food or drink had to be purchased so we couldnt even get a warm cup of coffee or teas it is the third time i have flown with ba recently and was unhappy each time but did not write a review will honestly never fly them again if i can help it
 trip verified  this is the worst experience i have ever had with any airline i flew with british airline on august st  i had one checked bag that was lost at heathrow airport i am aware that at that time there was a system error with the baggage belt and many travelers were affected i filed a report for my missing bag on the same day i arrived at lax airport and that was on august st i waited patiently for three weeks which is the time frame to either find the bag or be eligible for a compensation when i did not receive any update on my lost bag i filed a claim for compensation and that was on september th since then i have been waiting for a response from the customer relation with no good signs of resolving the issue i emailed them and tried to update the claim but still no response until today i contacted the baggage team and they were not helpful and did not ease my prolonged waiting the only way to contact customer relations is via the website and theyre not even getting back to me every time i talk to a customer service agent they tell me to wait some more i have been waiting for almost three months now and my issue is not resolved yet this whole experience was a hassle very unprofessional for a renowned airline like ba
 trip verified   flying lhr t to cpt november   ba app and website not working properly  would not load my ticket lhr t smooth and calm checking process quick  but boarding card would not scan at security they gave me one for someone else to a different destination  ran back to checkin to get correct one bags also tagged incorrectly and had disappeared  someone ran off to find my bags in the depths of t and retag them amazingly they did show up in cape town  told only main lounge was open not b and c pier lounges turns out this was false information  b pier lounge was open but i was in main lounge which was overcrowded and worn out arrived late to the gate train not working there was a biz class lane quick but then a giant queue to get on the plane as they only had one airbridge not two seat comfy and cabin clean but the sinks were taped up as the waste was not working i was offered hand sanitiser instead but this is disgusting imagine going to the bathroom and not being able to wash your hands as there is no sink unbelievable that ba dispatches planes in this condition food average wine served way too late choice of wine with cold food or eat food first and matching wines come a quarter of an hour later overall experience  flew air france fortalaza to cdg to lhr two weeks earlier which was way better how embarrassing for ba
not verified  worst experience ever outbound flight was cancelled and i was not notified i was rebooked on a very uncomfortable trip inbound flight delayed  hour also not notified on top of it they boarded my hand luggage which was the only bag i had extra wait in milan then food is horrible
 trip verified   check in was a shambles at bwi just  counters open for a very full flight the bag drop queue was even longer than the regular checkin queue boarding was done by zones so that was carried out reasonably well once on board the fas were fine not as engaging on my outbound flight to iad the aircraft was cramped and the seats in economy were horrible i was seated in an aisle seat row f where there is an entertainment box taking up a third of your legroom overall very cramped seat poor legroom and awful ife screens the meal was mediocre and there was no bar service before the meal this time on lading we were served a hot sandwich which had oozing cheese all over the wrapper so it was not pleasant to handle but tasted very good the plane landed at a remote stand which meant that we had to be bussed to t and since it was raining it was not a nice experience overall i rate this just as a mediocre journey
 trip verified  beyond disgusted with the fact that my baggage has yet to be delivered to me after  weeks of emails and calls to ba two pieces reported th september ba responses are generic non specific and all attempts to speak to a customer service worker are obstructed all this from an airline touting its values and claiming yo be one of the best in the world disgraceful does not fully describe their customer service
 trip verified  on july th  i had submitted a complaint form with regards to the fact that ba had misplaced our luggage during our wedding trip to italy and weve lost  days and incurred additional expenses in retrieving them for which i had provided all copy of receipts for i requested for my expenses to be reimbursed they agreed i sent all requested information and was told in  weeks i will be receiving it its  months later and british airways has not processed my reimbursements and stopped answering my followups on the matter
 trip verified   i booked the flight on oct  but have to cancel the flight on the same day after learning that i cant get my entry visa in time for the flight and i did receive a confirmation email says my flight was canceled but in the cancellation email the booking reference number is a different one so i requested cancellation but ba canceled another persons flight and sent the confirmation to my email i assumed that my flight was canceled but after more than  weeks i still have not received any refund so i reached out and it turned out my flight is still on and it is getting even more ridiculous when you try to reach out to ba i tried multiple different ways phone calls and emails but none was able to investigate what actually happened nor has the authority help cancel my flight without paying penalty based on my experience no ones reads your email carefully no matter how much context you put in given all i have experienced i have zero faith in british airways
 trip verified   london to gibraltar on th october  i booked my flight several months ahead of travel and was rather disappointed by the experience  ba attempt to nickle and dime the customers with outrageous seat selection prices offering of a very small bottle of water and a nutribar as a breakfast and one gains the impression of where ba aim to be positioned at of late the a has was no inflight entertainment or a route map the staff disappeared for most of the flight the flight was punctual but i felt cheated and under whelmed by the experience 
not verified   ive generally been a loyal gold status flyer with ba if they fly the route im after but my recent flight to nairobi was about as abysmal as you can get we should have departed at  but after continuous delays finally left  hours late not ideal when youve then got an hr  flight staff informed us virtually as we took off that the meal and drinks service would be started and completed asap as they needed to get rest because of hours we had been delayed they couldnt get it out and away quickly enough that was then basically the last you saw of them until they came around an hour or so before landing i sincerely hope they enjoyed their rest because when you pay full fare for business class service you actually expect a service they were all extremely miserable and clearly didnt want to be on board were still waiting for you to pay our compensation that has been awarded to us by the official ombudsman in july for the cancellation of our flight to miami in march this was cancelled at am for the  pm flight 
 trip verified   a great flight the suites on this aircraft really provide maximum comfort british has returned to full service so meals were coursed menus and hot towels providedetc food was quite good with choices provided for both meals service was ok i prefer to have the same person serving me rather than a hodge pudge but thats my preference entertainment was good as was connectivity no real complaints except a minor one the tray table seemed far from me while eating in its closest position i actually felt like i was in a true business class not by qatars standards but thats another story
 trip verified   i am happy to say that this flight was quite good except for the second rate euro business seating everything was very well done a friendly informative cabin crew served a good hot breakfast while being very communicative to folks nervous about heathrow transit well done unfortunately a bus gate was used upon arrival
 trip verified   just a few years ago flying on ba was enjoyable but times have changed these days about five hours on board the plane is no fun at all the terminal  experience still feels classy and on the way out it felt well staffed and efficient on board though its just become an experience to be endured bas mean decision to split seats into nicer for the first half of the plane and nastier for the rest underlines this there is no entertainment no magazine refreshment purchases are brought to the seat after ordering from an app there is no attempt to provide fresh or hot food on the day despite the competition being able to do this is it too much to ask for when trapped on board for five hours you get a free tiny bottle of water and a small cereal bar on the outbound flight the crew collected rubbish just once before landing but helpfully tied a bag around a toilet door down the back in case anyone wanted to fight their way past and clear things up themselves recline buttons have been deleted on the seats and the seat pitch feels squeezed on the return flight for one reason or another due to bas delays from the previous day we were just under two hours late getting off the plane late in the evening and some passengers couldnt travel at all because there were not enough crew the cabin crew were nonetheless distinctly more professional on this flight altogether i would say good things if there were any  but its hard to think of anything i could recommend ba for and that is a pity because it used to be a professional company to deal with and a pleasure worth looking forward to when making european journeys
 trip verified   a very positive experience with ba seats were new style club seats and very comfortable for sleep food was fine but not outstanding wifi good and video screen large and bright baggage came out very quickly at heathrow had the same experience on the return flight to atlanta all in all would fly ba again but would probably want to make sure it is new seats
 trip verified  baby across the aisle cried nonstop and crew yakked in the galley so on this long flight there was no possibility for any sleep or even rest mentioning to a crew member that their colleagues were talking loudly made no difference at all my second meal was something inedible no way to get a simple bag of crisps or nuts instead an assortment of dried something baggage took  hour to be delivered and had no priority for club or even first passengers we were all kept waiting after many economy bags had been delivered a is a great aircraft but the ba seating is still the very tired old yinyang configuration with some people stuck in the middle of  seats probably not what anyone is expecting in business class these days
 trip verified   evening flight from lhr to iad on an a check in at t is poor most of their kiosks dont work well and staff have to be called boarding was very poorly managed the ground staff were overwhelmed because it was a full flight and were struggling to manage passengers the gate was small and there was insufficient seating for such a big aircraft the flight was full and it left  minutes late but the pilot kept us informed on this issue once airborne service started quite quickly and the cabin crew were very pleasant and helpful they did their job very professionally and efficiently they answered the call bells promptly and nothing was too much trouble they started out with a bar service and were generous with drinks and then came the meal service and the food was very good the ife was old and clunky but had sufficient movies and tv programmes for a  hour flight the seat was comfortable but legroom was tight all in it was an uneventful journey and i would give it the thumbs up but ground services needs attention
 trip verified   we boarded our flight at edinburgh to london for our connecting flight to san francisco on th october there were a lot of americas heading back to america from scotland because of the open golf at st andrews the woman at the counter was rude i was actually embarrassed to be british at the time shouting snapping at people and just had a real horrible way about her on the flight from london to san francisco prior to the  hour check in i spent  to reserve two seats for our once in a life time holiday to america once we boarded it was evident that the seat i was sitting in was broken the recliner button was not working and had been pushed into the frame of the arm rest i asked the flight attendant at the time of there was anything that could be done but not only was she also rude but seemed uninterested in that fact that i was going to have to sit for  hours on a flight with a seat that wouldnt recline i eventually got the flight to state that she would report the fault only to find out that multiple other seats on the economy seating area were also broken attitude with british airways staff has been absolutely horrendous so after getting off the flight i decided to make a complaint to british airways bearing in mind that i had paid  for the privilege of picking a seat i asked for a refund for the cost of the booking of the seat prior to the  hour check in only to be told no they dont do refunds i paid for a product that was broken met with nothing but rude staff and they are telling me they cant refund the cost of booking the seat  emails to the customer team and they are still refusing they are also refusing to tell me whether or not that the fault was reported prior to me sitting in that seat all they have now offered me is a  ba voucher which i declined on the basis that if they picked my seats for example i hadnt payed for the seats prior to the  hour check in then a  voucher would be ok but not when i have spent my own money to select a seat that was broken after all my experiences with ba i will not be using them again very rude and unhelpful staff and i will chose another carrier in the future im actually ashamed that ba treats people the way they do when they are a national airline for great britain
 trip verified   while entering the aircraft it was very rushed no smooth boarding people were struggling with cabin luggage and finding their seats and heating was high that i was suffocating i got faint due to that heat but the cabin crew were very helping so all the thanks to those who helped me at that time other then that when i called cabin crew to ask for some water they took half an hour to response 
not verified   lhrlax i prefer the boeing  over the a as the seats dont seem too cramped checkin was very easy with the kiosks as was bag drop and security at heathrow t is a whole other story once through security its up the escalator up the stairs up the elevator down the escalator get to the gate no seating then down an escalator and finally down the jet bridge to the plane i have been in and out of heathrow many times but never in t before anyway cabin crew were pleasant drinks and meal service were fine it was a day flight so no real sleeping and passengers were all moving around most of the flight the entertainment system was good with decent options so i occupied my time with several movies nice landing at lax all in all ba was just fine
 trip verified   flew back to uk from miami in new club world suite  a huge improvement on the elderly yin and yang style club world boarding easy took off  hour late due to delayed incoming aircraft but made up this time on way back and landed on time very comfortable suite with plenty of storage for bits and pieces bedding and large pillow supplied attentive fas  especially anna who addressed me by name however let down by very average catering not very good short rib beef and underwhelming salmon for my wife and sadly once again a very poor choice of films on the ife which let down the excellent inch touch screen refused to pay bas extortionate prepay to book your seat fees and still got  seats together cmon ba  do we not pay enough already to travel club class  i can recommend bas new club class and we will travel this way  if we can afford it  in future
 trip verified   i flew with hand baggage but security at dubai was quick entered lounge which was a bit small but good and drink offerings sound flight on a left on time few technical issues with ife which would have been really irritating had it been a day flight decent snack and slept well arrivals lounge excellent would recommend
not verified  london to cairo first on this  hour mid morning flight the only complimentary food and drink were a tiny bag of pretzels and a small bottle of water even southwest is more generous when unable to connect my phone to order food i hit the fa call button with no response for more than an hour when the fa came to collect garbage i had to show him the call light and he gruffly asked me what was the matter he used his phone to place the order
 trip verified   this review is specifically about maddie crew member who took care of us she was attentive warm friendly and nothing was too much trouble smiling from start to finish she should be the brand ambassador for ba
 trip verified    hours in a cramped single aisle aircraft no inflight entertainment in economy there is no free catering other than a bottle of water a packet of crisps and a minimal selection of food items for purchase
not verified   dfwlhr had an easy transfer at dfw from american airlines to british airways heading to london first ride on an a left me with the feeling that this plane type wont ever be my first choice was seated upstairs where the cabin space seemed very roomy but the seats and rows were very cramped when the passenger in front reclined the back of the seat was  inches from my face and i had a real difficult time trying to view the seat back entertainment screen the seat itself wasnt too bad but i felt squished and locked in on a plus side having a window seat gave me this nice storage area by my side ground staff were pleasant and cabin crew were really nice plenty of beverages offered and multiple water runs were made during the night dinner was rubbish as was the morning prelanding snack the entertainment system was very responsive and had a pretty good selection of movies tv music and games all in all it was an ok experience and did get me to london on time and our baggage arrived safely but im not sold on the a t at lhr is another story that will be in a different review what a mess that place is
 trip verified   check in at jersey straightforward there is a small business class lounge at jersey with reasonable drinks range and some limited food flight boarded on time but take off was delayed due to poor visibility at lhr captain kept us well informed and we eventually took off  mins behind schedule with a  minute late arrival at heathrow good service from the cabin crew and a bacon roll and coffee served disappointing that the wait for cases at heathrow t was as long as the flight
 trip verified   check in at lhr t was very quick and queue for security short we used the south lounge which was supposed to be the quieter at the time but was very busy and difficult for our group of  to get seated together flight boarded on time whilst this is only a short flight  mins the service of the cabin crew was outstanding glass of champagne coronation chicken salad and a coffee all served with a smile and a little banter in spite of some of the issues with ba their cabin crew are usually exceptional and this was no exception flight landed on time and bags delivered quite promptly
 trip verified  the checkin process was smooth i got access to the iga lounge which was nice but not as nice has the turkish airlines lounge on board was what all this flight was about this was my first time flying intraeuropean business class and though i was well prepared i still found it underwhelming first the seat is just a normal economy seat with the middle seat blocked off there is no personal ife so basically no entertainment for a hour flight meal service was very slow and by the time it reached half of the business class cabin one of the  choices ran out plus the meal was not as good as the economy meal i got on my turkish airlines flight a few days ago i could see that staff did their best but since there were  business class passengers on a single aisle aircraft with a small galley there was so much they could do also the  passengers shared one single wc meaning a long line for the bath room something i have rarely seen in business class arrived at lhr we did not get a contact gate but the thing was that there was no bus either and the crew announced that they had no idea when the bus would come it finally came of course and the delay was more on the airport than the airline but since ba is the main operator at heathrow t such things will affect their reputation
 trip verified  this is my first time flying bas new club suite which in my opinion is very good flight to the us including mine departed from concourse c of terminal  which did not have many shopping or dining options however it was quiet so finding seating was quite easy the highlight is the club suite which is spacious and provides a great deal of privacy meal service was slow and everything was served on one tray all at once i think now is the time for them to begin to get back to prepandemic standard at least the food tasted good which was not something i previously experienced on ba flights even in first class
 trip verified   my am flight for a conference in june was cancelled with less than h notice  without being given any alternative flight or rebook me upon alternative flight upon calling customer service customer service who said she can only get me a flight  days later they did not work with me as i miss  days of conference they asked me to travel to a different airport in sweden stockholm which i reluctantly agreed to as i was not given any other choice  but i had to pay for that domestic flight myself upon reaching the gothenburg airport on the day of departure i saw a direct flight to heathrow called customer service and was told there is  seat available so i changed to am from gothenburg  heathrow  jersey however at this point ba told me i have to pay a fee of gbp  as i changed my flight a nd time  i find it a disgrace that ba charge a fee to change a flight that they cancelled and they were unable to give alternative options to reach my destination in for the conference ba proposed that i travel to another airport in sweden at my own expense i have since contacted ba for the legal compensation im entitled to according to uk law but i got a rejection as they claim i arranged my own travel to my destination if i have a choice i will never travel ba again such awful customer service and complete lack of understanding of customer needs

 trip verified   british airways personnel was just magnificent my flight into london was delayed security had long lines i ran like a madman to find the gate closed but the plane was still there the lady at the gate worked the computer at  miles an hour to allow me to board the software program was already closed this while the flight manager who came towards the gate urging her to make a decision since the plane was about to loose its take off spot in line i was sweating from the run still out of breath while she handed me my passport giving me the green light to board i bolted again into the plane feeling bad that i did not personally thank her for her magic i really hope she gets recognized by british airways for her performance thank you for all you do

 trip verified   london to istanbul british airways business class rows comprise of three seats with the middle seat empty front rows about  are considered as business class with very short leg space  no pillows no blanket horrible inflight service staff were harassing me no curtesy for business class checkin while waiting for flights 
not verified  london to manchester british airways is probably the worst air company i have ever flown with they took  hours to unload the luggage and the flight was delayed by an hour the staff were no help and frankly rude
not verified   flight was cancelled at the last minute due to weather despite pretty much all other flights not being affected booked onto a flight the next day arrived at the airport  hours ahead t horrendous checkin and security delays meant we almost missed the new flight the flight was fine once we got on it but the damage was done
 trip verified   after having a few not so good experiences in the past i feel i have to write a positive review as well where it is deserved first of all the improvement in the ba lounge in gatwick is massive the buffet was a joy we flew on a ba flight but operated by iberia express wonderful staff and the food was exceptional whoever brought in this change of food supplier  congratulations also may i add that this time business class was not  rows like last time but  rows which was definitely a big improvement and could be felt in a much more attentive service i am still not clear on luggage being labelled priority the luggage certainly does not come out first in the destination airports
not verified   this review is for ba booking system not a flight  today i clicked wrong date on line my mistake and expect to pay a fee i then go to cancel booking and click on the option to not receive a voucher immediately i received a response saying my voucher is on its way i call them and speak to a gentleman who continuously spoke over me and would not listen to my concerns and eventually i give up and want to book a new flight obviously at a much higher price but using the voucher i didnt want however to my surprise i am unable to use this voucher because they cant tell me what it is until i receive it at a point in the future that they cant say when so they now have my money and i have to rebook at full cost in the end in order to get me off the phone they hung up

 trip verified   our flight in march  from san francisco to london on th march was cancelled with  hours notice we found out on the shuttle bus to the airport we had to stay overnight for the next day flight we still have not been recompensed for our expenses filled in on line and have received no replies on followups it is the usual  min or longer time to wait on customer service picking up during this trip we had to reschedule a return flight my wife was ill this should not have been a problem as the flights were rebookable we were given a voucher this voucher was only bookable by phone when i phoned to rebook we got the automated voice saying ba were not taking flight bookings by phone you can see the problem  how do a use a voucher where i must phone and they are not taking phone bookings  all i have been offered is another voucher the time to use has passed it must be great to be a business that can print endless a vouchers and not return money paid for services not rendered we returned home with aer lingus with no drama
not verified   i sat in seat c our cabin crew lady was called gina and she went above and beyond to keep the customers happy she greeted us as we boarded with a very cheery smile she engaged with two families travelling with young children and gave out games and books her trolley service was excellent and she took great care in what she was doing she had time for a quick chat and i think she said she was half german and half bulgarian a really lovely young lady who is a credit to british airways
 trip verified   full afternoon flight ready to fly on time arrived early uneventful flight good service pre dinner drinks drink with meal coffee drinks available at back avml meal was tasty hard working crew on a full flight audio worked well
 trip verified   i was told id require a  hr negative covid test for entry into philippines booked my trip via bacom with a transfer in singapore they delay my transfer to the next day okay not too bothered as have my  hr negative covid test but when i try to check in at changi airport the philippines airlines check in staff require a  hr negative covid test had to rush to a different terminal get tested wait for the result rush back to check in the gate had closed  had to book an extra night in singapore hotel book my own flight to manila then also the return journey back to london if one misses one leg of a ba booked flight the remaining flights get cancelled  i discovered oman air business class and better then british airways from treating their customers quality of service the business class experience
 trip verified   having been promised help to find a hotel room after an outgoing flight from heathrow was running very late and my hotel would be closed i boarded the plane on this basis i was subsequently dumped at barcelona airport at  to sleep the night on the floor there was no help at there to find a hotel i have ms and cant walk without help ba did nothing their partners iberia did nothing at about  am some kind people helped me to an more secure area and toilet and got me some sandwiches i lost my holiday my hotel booking and my music course ba insist its not their fault its the hotels for closing i would not have got on the plane had i known i found out i could go to arbitration ba now say they will withdraw the offer of expenses if i do their policy of refusing all compensation for what would have been a dreadful experience for any passenger is bad enough for someone who is not mobile it seems to have ditched the specific responsibilities of duty of care and towards disabled passengers so for people with disabilities its just not worth the risk of travelling with ba
 trip verified   i am a business class customer british airways cancelled my return flight and chose an alternative flight with  stops after i complained they changed the date when i told them the date would not work they attempted to charge me additional  for the change i submitted a complaint and have not heard anything  if you try to reach out no chance

not verified   my husband parents who are in their s and i were traveling back to ny from naples italy and had a stopover at heathrow london let me just say we were not happy when we arrived late to london and missed our connecting flight back to ny the reason writing this review is the great customer service that kashmir dhami gave us she was very helpful in booking all four of us on the same flight the very next day which was very hard to do because we all had different bookings so it just made it all so difficult but she got it done she is so kind and is amazing at her job

 trip verified   flight on a sfo to lhr smooth check in at san francisco airport quiet and efficient dedicated ba lounge excellent food and beverage options and attentive staff lounge was very crowded though minor departure delay and onto a upper deck i prefer the club world cabin on the upper deck as it is very much quieter old style product but clean and well maintained staff offered a good level of service and reasonable meals on time arrival baggage quite slow a good flight overall
 trip verified   for this  hour  min flight you are given a bag of potato chips and a bottle of water if you want to purchase more food and drink you do this via their app on your phone or like me you can preorder weeks before you fly however there is no guarantee you will get your order mine never came so after enquiring where the order was they told me they had food for someone who was not on the plane that someone was me it turned out they also managed to lose my luggage  i am still waiting for them to contact me regarding it i will never use them again
 trip verified   my wife and i booked a flight in april  that included a return trip from edinburgh thru london to washington when we checked in at edinburgh airport  hours ahead of time we were informed there were no more seats available on our scheduled flight we asked how this was possible and were simply told that others had checked in online which we hadnt done  we were instructed to come back in  hrs and  mins still with our luggage unchecked and not yet going thru security to see if we could get on the flight via standby we waited and then finally at  pm  mins before our scheduled  pm flight we were told we could be on the flight and were given boarding passes for the flight to london but no boarding passes for the connecting flight  mins after arrival time our luggage was not checked thru to washington but only to london we were told wed get thru security on time to make the flight and it was suggested that staff would assist us when we got to security check area the line was massively long we questioned a ba staff member who said we had to get in line like the others we decided to pay  pounds to go through fast track security to make our flight we got to the gate in time yet due to a delayed departure caused in part by luggagespace issues on the plane our flight arrived in london  mns late and after going to the flight connections we were told  mins before the scheduled departure with a vague explanation of there isnt enough time that we could not be given a boarding pass for our flight we were then directed to baggage claim to retrieve our luggage and then proceed to the checkin area to be rebooked for a later flight when we got to the checkin counter area a ba staff person standing at entrance to the checkin line advised us we should try to call our travel agency to rebook because the line for checking in had not hardly moved in  hrs when we finally got thru on the phone we were informed that the best ba could do for us was to get us on a flight  days later and then not to our original destination iad but to baltimore i was not told or assured id be compensated for this extreme expense of staying  more days in a hotel  just that i could go to the ba website and make a claim online this ugly experience still ongoing has ruined our trip to the uk 
not verified   decent flight and airplane non existing customer service for refunds and support after delayed flight flight on th june from vancouver to london airport was delayed for roughly  hours we received a  cad voucher for some drinks this was appreciated because of this delay we missed our connecting flight to amsterdam from london within the airplane we have been informed to go towards the british airway information desk to reschedule another flight towards amsterdam when we left the airplane in london there where  employees working and a  people waiting line we asked around towards the nice employees british airways have and we have been told this was the only linedesks to get a reschedule for our flight to amsterdam so we had to wait and be patient after  hours of waiting and being roughly halfway the line we felt like uninformed cattle in an h waiting line with only candy bars and sugar cookies to eat  at some point after  hours they were giving away hotel vouchers and shuttle bus vouchers because we couldnt sleepstay at the airport as we noticed on the website we have been assigned another flight this flight was about to leave tuesday morning it was sunday pm when we arrived in london this meant we have to spent  additional days in london before we were able to fly to the netherlands we have been told by the employees we could arrange our own transfer back to the netherlands and save the receipts and we will get a refund on the costs hotel food transport and a refund on the flight for tuesday as we where not going to take this flight they released out baggage gave us a hotel voucher and cancelled the tuesday flight they gave us we were going to make our own travel back to the netherlands seems british airways claims  refund process is non responsive as we already requested information  times for our compensation but received nothing yet apart from an automated email saying we could get a small refund based on our missed flight 
not verified   reasonably smooth boarding meal service was smooth ad efficient but no ice or spirits available as no room on the trolley  could they have offered to serve this afterwards seat was very uncomfortable indeed on this aircraft so got little if any sleep on the long overnight flight cabin crew spent much of the time between meals talking loudly at the rear galley meaning we couldnt sleep even if the seats were comfortable this was so disrespectful and inconsiderate
 trip verified   three flights london to reykjavik return and frankfurt to london generally the flights were of an acceptable standard though the seats and legroom are quite tight for a threehour flight the cabin crews were efficient and generally friendly a big plus for ba was informative announcements from the cockpit often missing on other airlines flights operated generally close to the advertised times but ba was let down by chaotic checkin and boarding procedures in preparation for each flight the number of checkin staff was one or at most two in frankfurt the lone checkin agent was also checking in business class passengers why are economy class passengers boarded from the front and not from the back this was standard across the three flights but slowed down the boarding process immensely as people seated further back tried to get past forward seated passengers stowing their enormous cabin baggage it would make much more sense to board people at the back first and to enforce baggage rules so that cabin crew are not wandering up and down the cabin trying to find overhead space for the hapless passengers who boarded last the small bottle of water and a halffull bag of crisps offered as a snack on a threehour flight to iceland was just tokenism and compared badly with what air france offered on a subsequent short flight to paris at reykjavik there was no departure lounge next to the gate  passengers had to queue wherever they could in the corridor
 trip verified  routine typical ba domestic shuttle flight nothing special departure five minutes early but no one to greet flight upon arrival hence a  minute delay crew were attentive and charming usual clean cut ba product that when it works well is fine
 trip verified   over  week ago i cancelled  club europe flights due to testing positive for covid the day before they were booked many months ago and eligible for the travel voucher so i opted for this online since then absolute silence and ba pages state it might take up to a week previous vouchers have been received within a few hours of cancellation as a very loyal ba customer for more than  years i am appalled at the absolute state of chaos that the airline now portrays with a further  bookings with ba planned for the rest of  i have to admit that travelling with them ex lhr has now become an absolute nightmare
not verified   flight delayed slightly due to luggage conveyor breaking down luggage never made it to toronto and we filed a lost baggage report within  hours our luggage arrived in toronto and a wonderful ba representative went down into the baggage loading area to retrieve it for me would definitely give ba a  star rating and have them again
 trip verified   check in and security at lhr efficient went to galleries north which was busy but fine with good service left from b gates efficient boarding with welcome drinks and menus this was my first time on the club suite travelling with  children ba moved our seated but we were all seated near to each other and they apologised for this at check in it was a full flight in all cabins so staff busy i liked the new suite which felt superior to the old club world product the entertainment was excellent and the screen large and well positioned the menu was quite limited but the quality was reasonable prior to covid one could pre order mains in club which might be worth bringing back as it happened we all ordered and were able to have the beef dish but i doubt my children would have liked the vegetarian korma had they run out the club kitchen ran out of food quite quickly it was a long flight so this was not surprising but my children were quite hungry as a result part of this was the result of other passengers from other cabins taking food from it the second meal was fine and the cabin service director did source an alternative meal for my children from economy which i thought was quite good on time arrival prompt disembarkation and bags off quickly we dont tend to have a good track record with bag delivery so this was a pleasant surprise overall a good flight
 trip verified  washington to london our flight was unexpectedly cancelled my husband spent hours on the phone in the middle of the night to try and rebook our flight we were told by the customer service representative that we should just cancel our trip after spending thousands in lodging tickets tours etc when we finally rebooked we still lost one day one day of lodging and tickets to a show we tried to at least get another day on the end of our trip but no one could help us no one cared that our family vacation was totally altered and cost us a bunch of money we are so disappointed and angry with the customer service here
not verified  nairobi to new york via london british airways has given me such grief trying to cancel a ticket for my uncle who passed away they canceled a ticket instead for my newly widowed aunt after they split her booking off the original booking it is now less than two weeks until her scheduled flight and i have been trying to amend her booking and hours and hours i have spent on hold or with an agent being told that my query has been prioritized and that i will receive a call back within  hours i call every  days and nothing has been done to reinstate her ticket and no agent can ever resolve the situation i will never book with ba again sure flying with them is easy but their total lack of practical assistance has caused distress and frustration and so many hours of wasted time and to think i spent more money on a ticket with ba than other cheaper carriers thinking it would make my life easier big mistake
not verified   today my husband and a friend flew from dublin to london city airport all apparently went well from checkin through the flight after that the ineptitude and lack of systems seemed to be in full bloom we waited and waited for our bags to come off the baggage carriage but neither my husbands nor mine came i found a ba service person to help me he told me that there were  bags checked and  on the plane  i thought one of our bags made it then two other customers from the same flight were complaining to someone else that they too had not gotten their bags so i assumed the  out of  was some kind of interesting fiction i was then told to file a claim on bacom which we did at this time about  hours after our flight landed the system says they have no idea where our bags are now ive had bags not get on flights before  less and less as airlines have tracked their bags fastidiously i usually fly united airlines which tracks your bag at every stage of the flight with updated info  eg your bag was loaded onto the plane your bag is on its way to baggage claim ba doesnt seem to have anything like this in this case again it appears ba cannot even locate the bag i hadnt flown ba in many years and with experience i would never book them again

not verified   i booked a flight for myself and my wife from heathrow to nairobi in premium economy using frequent flyer points i then paid  to reserve two seats on our own in a  configuration cabin as i didnt want to sit in a row of  people if possible a few weeks before our flight ba emailed me to say they had changed my seat selection when i logged in to see my new seat selection i had been moved into a row of  the email also stated that if i wasnt happy with the new seat selection they had made for me i could get a full refund of the money i had paid i called to cancel the reservation which they did and i paid  cancelation fee and they refunded my frequent flyer miles when i asked them to refund the fee for my seat reservation they told me all seat reservation fees are non refundable i read them the email they had sent me when they changed my reserved seats but the repeated that seat reservations are always non refundable
 trip verified   departure was about  minutes late the a we flew on was about eighteen months old the seating spacing in economy class seems very tight and if the seat in front is fully tilted back it is a real challenge to get out of the seat the screen becomes so close to your face it becomes difficult to focus on the screen audio was so poor due to music drowning the conversation i gave up trying to watch the cabin crew seemed to really struggle with service it felt very disorganised felt sorry for the cabin crew they seemed to be working hard and there seems to be a lot of up and down the aisles on this type of aircraft  felt unnatural the overhead bins are very high and many passengers had difficulty accessing their belongings during the flight i tried using the overhead attendant light to verify my wifes meal but no one responds  better to stop a flight attendant in the aisle nice aircraft for a two hour flight but no fun for close to eleven hours i am going to explore other options before using ba again the hassle to make contact with anybody before the flight puts you off before you even go to the airport
not verified   was going from belfast to london but they cancelled the flight and we didnt even know it was cancelled someone behind us had to tell us we had a connecting flight and spent a lot of money on our holiday the refund takes ages overall not happy at all 
not verified   second time getting poor service from ba st unable to contact via phone email or website nd even with four business class tickets across the atlantic they do not allow free seat selection or check in until  hours prior to the flight do they understand what the last  hours of an international trip are like by the time we confirmed our seats my wife and our kids were spread throughout the plane of course noone at the airport could do anything 
not verified   booked a flight from london to paris  trip was cancelled due to covid lockdowns we asked ba staff for refund told cannot do but will issue vouchers we stated no good for two elderly people from australia as would not know when we can travel informed no other option and silly vouchers sent now they are running out of date and unusable have been asking for two years for refund many many emails they keep saying we took vouchers had no choice does anyone have any other options re complaints we would be most grateful really not fair to just take our money 
not verified   we left mia late due to an issue with the provisioning of the plane we arrived late and so missed our connection at lhr to cdg at lhr british airways rebooked us on not  but  flights to cdg and as such said i never took the flight to cdg and then cancelled my flight back to mia since i did not take my flight they did credit my avios for the one flight but said i never took it thus i had to book on another airline to return at the last moment trying to call ba was a nightmare on hold for over  hour a total of  extra on my calling plan only to not be helped as the person did not know what to do so he had us contact duty office who does not handle flight only problems feeding us back to the number we just called and were unable to be helped ba cost me  overall we have flown them for years reaching silver and gold status but never again they under new leadership have sunk to less than a budget low cost airline in customer service while charging premium rates  dont be fooled
not verified   the flight was delayed over  hours and this of course caused us to missed our connection flight and change to a different route finally i lost my luggage and no one has any information i will never again travel with british airways
not verified   terrible experience with british airways i was obligated to checkin my carryon suitcase due to my group number according to the girl at the front desk then they could miss my two suitcases plus the luggage of my boyfriend who traveled with me after  days they delivered  of our  bags and since then the promise of deliver the last one persists now already  days passed and still no information of where the last suitcase is always the promise that the bag will be delivered today but it never happens no respect with the customer first and last time with british airways for sure i dont recommend at all
 trip verified   ba cancelled my flight i never got on it couldnt book another and refunded about a quarter of what i spent despite their covid guarantees  i was booked onto a flight with ba for april th  from hong kong to london they cancelled the flight so i looked at rebooking for a later date covid ticketing flexibility assurances couldnt find a flight up to and including october so i opted for the refund thinking id get a full refund i was refunded about  of what i paid i called their service centre for an explanation as i couldnt fathom how they could cancel the flight not have any other flights available and i didnt get a full refund each phone call takes about  minutes before you get to talk to customer service and thats where the frustration begins the customer service people were adamant that a full refund should be given and asked me to wait while they escalate the case a month later and about  phone calls later thats  hours waiting on the phone they finally refunded me a little more  in total less than  of what i paid it would seem to get a refund in increments i would have had to call their customer service for them to take me round in circles until i got frustrated and give up so instead of calling i enquired about this via their website  just for an answer as to why i wasnt getting a full refund i didnt cancel my booking neither was it my fault they decided to stop flight to hk after another month of waiting  this is the reason they gave in an email thanks for contacting us about your claim for eu compensation were sorry it was necessary to cancel your flight to heathrow on  april  your claims been refused because ba was cancelled because of non payable commercial reason further to your request i would advise to kindly get in touch with our customer support team to know the status of the refund as the same is looked after by our support team we take all reasonable measures to avoid disruption to a flight and we always consider if there are any other alternative solutions before we make a decision the cancellation was out of our control and caused unforeseen disruption to our schedule thanks again for following this up with us please feel free to contact us if we can help you any further and i hope we have the chance to welcome you on board again soon best regards british airways customer relations i dont know what non payable commercial reason is i am out about  sterling going to just leave it their and boycott this company
 trip verified   belfast to london on  jun  i was informed at about  flight ba has been delayed to  will only reach london heathrow at  i reached the airport at  but ba counter was only open at  at checkin counter i approached ba ground staff for advice as i have a connecting singapore airlines flight at  on the same day the reply was it is the customers responsibility to contact the airline theres nothing we can do i was given a card with contact info on ba customer service and sales for the next  hrs in the airport i have been trying to contact ba but was told that hotline only operates from  i have to called another number for urgent cases which ever number i dial i just couldnt get to speak to any one till  again i was told that theres nothing they could do because my connecting flight is singapore airlines onboard the aircraft when i approached for help with my luggage to be placed to the compartment i was told that its the customers responsibility to do it on their own  i would think twice to take ba in the future
not verified   the customer service of british airways is really bad you cant reach any call centre agent even after waiting for  mins now i really appreciate emirates and turkish airlines after facing bas low quality customer service not only the customer service but the food they offer during a long haul ldnjnb is really low quality other airline operators which are working with doco for flight catering are way better than ba i guess ba has selected the lowest budget option from doco overall my rating is  for ba  you can feel how stingy ba is when you fly with them note respect to their cabin crew
 trip verified  ba is still charging premium airlines fares however delivering nothing better than what a low cost offers seat does not recline legroom is minimal causing anyone taller than m a torture to fly as being in a sardine can good old times of being a glamour flying ba has far gone ground force almost reduced to  only a very cheap pack of crispy and water the only positive side is the cabin crew always there for you and happy or well pretending at least for the price they charge i advise every passenger to fly any other low cost airline as an alternative you pay extra for absolutely nothing
 trip verified   this a new route which ba introduced at the beginning of june after several years of covid related delays the business class experience was i fear typical of the nickel  dime policies introduced by the airline over the past decade plus  helpful and friendly fa minuses  the cabin was fairly cramped with six seats across each pod had surprisingly little room with only very limited storage space it was hard to adjust the seat particularly getting it to lie flat  even the fa found it difficult the inflight entertainment was very limited with a poor choice of films tv programmes and music the food choice and quality was poor  one of the three mains was unavailable and my pea and mushroom risotto was almost inedible the cheese selection was also poor i dont know what the business class offerings from bas rivals flying similar routes are like but the experience does not match up to that provided by singapore airlines on their flights to the far east and australasia
 trip verified   as a regular ba customer on european flights it is sad but true to note that standards continue to slip particularly ground service at lhr and the atrocious handling of delays staff at the entrance to the first wing was brusque to put it mildly rude to be accurate flight boarded at  for a  departure  mins later  late customers were allowed to board and not a single pa or apology from the flight deck or crew the benefit of low cost airlines is they they dont hang around for latecomers sadly ba is in a time warp over this ba pilots used to be some of the best for updating status but this has dropped dramatically in the last  years the food standards and choices in the t first lounge are one of the items that have been improved post covid inflight service on this short h m flight was a light dinner tray only  choices by row   with  passengers in club europe only  salad options were available no printed menu offered and the cabin staff explained he had only been given  menus for  customers it appears there is no supply control in place at ba food quality was okay but while doco supply this the doco meals on turkish airlines remain superior to what ba manages i flew turkish  days ago staff service was perfunctory but no attempt to interact with any customers in club europe cabin i end where i started ba standards continue to slip 
not verified   right now do not use british airways when booking person said we would have enough time between the connection flight to final destination but he was wrong flight to london was late we auto missed our flight to edinburgh and had to wait  hours for the next flight coming back once again flight leaving was late had to run to get connecting flight then we sat on tarmac for an hour because luggage had to go on so i thought good that is probably my luggage once back in boston luggage did not show up they said we would get it within  hours and we didnt so far it will be at least  days
not verified   i could very much understand losing my luggage for  days with how airports are doing this was a risk i was well aware about when travelling to greece for my wedding however in my many attempts to receive communication from this company it has been nothing but disappointment and upset the company at one point was picking up and immediately hanging up on my husband the most recent time i have called them is because i requested an agent from the luggage team give me a timeline of my bags location the man on the phone verbatim stated and if i dont after this he proceeded to tell me my bag was in edmonton with westjet and that this was not his problem before saying hold and not taking me off hold i did not book with westjetnor is this westjets luggage issue they have been amazing when i have called them and have given me the most info out of everyone i will never use this company again nor will anyone that i am close to this has been completely disheartening please please do not use this company if you would like your travel to have any chance of going smoothly or any chance of receiving adequate or even any information or communication i have never in my life been treated like this as a customer before
 trip verified   the a is a wonderful aircraft  quieter than any other aircraft ive flown flight was delayed arriving at vancouver from london which meant that departing flight from vancouver was also delayed passengers waited almost  minutes at london terminal  for baggage to arrive  excuse given by ba ground staff was that the baggage staff are very busy right now and our baggage will arrive soon onboard amenities and services quite disappointing seat was reasonably spacious but did not offer sufficient back support meal sizes and portions considerably smaller than when i last flown with ba  a tiny ham and cheese croissant for breakfast cabin crew noticeably absent from cabin during flight  no offer of water juice or other beverages during the flight overall a fairly disappointing experience with ba
 trip verified   lhr to sfo in new club suite rather chaotic embarkation despite small number of passengers pushback delayed by lack of tug club suite seats kk a huge improvement over previous cw product with excellent ife and a good range of movies cabin crew attentive and efficient food adequate and still served on the same tray arrival more or less on time but delayed by lack of marshal to guide plane to the air bridge long queue to get through immigration
 trip verified  covid form is broken  called customer service twice on different times and they hung up due to being too busy to pick up the phone  hour flight delay  was first in the queue and had to hand in my hand luggage due to there being not enough room which was untrue as most storage compartments where empty when i entered the plane i explained that i really cannot afford to wait on my luggage as i have  hours drive left after i arrive at the airport in short totally not customer friendly will try to avoid flying next time with ba
not verified   feels like ba are putting the economy back in premium economy very pleasant friendly and helpful cabin crew however it was over two hours before food was served on this alreadydelayed pm flight a single drink was offered in plastic cups before meal service and with the food you were offered wine only but the crew could come back later if you wanted something else  including water i drank wine anyway but i wouldnt leap at this offer given how long it took them to do food ive never experienced this on other airlines premium economy products i flew westjet this year and they took your drink orders just after you boarded then brought them to you before and then with your meal in glassware  brilliant air new zealand do glass and use your name throughout water eventually came round after wed eaten as i say the crew was pleasant and friendly but seemed underequipped understaffed or following poor procedures food was forgettable inflight entertainment was great and the screens large  unfortunately after every seatbelt light announcement the screens brightness levels reset to their retinasearing default not fun on a night flight with turbulence loos on this gatwick  were halfway down economy which was pandemonium or at the very back the upside to this layout is that pe is next to the exit so we deplaned very quickly checkin queue at cancun took forever couldnt see or hear gate announcements so everyone crowded the gate grateful for priority boarding in this situation bags arrived ok at gatwick no delay i continue to avoid ba unless using avios for business class or where there is no alternative bas problems all seem so easy to fix  their cabin crew are clearly eager to help you why arent they equipped and given service procedures to match other airlines at this price point
not verified   phoenix to london heathrow and then to hamburg despite a  hour layover in heathrow bags didnt make it onto the connecting flight once in hamburg there was no one at the baggage tracing desk and the number provided was a deadend no ability to leave a message or connect to an employee a group of passengers all missing checked baggage waited in the airport and tried every outlet possible checkin desk other baggage tracing desks calling emails for two hours to no avail the solution for us was to fill out a sheet of paper with contact info and baggage description four days later no information where my luggage is and no way to contact customer service absolutely miserable customer support our flights were alright but after such bad customer service we will never fly ba again
 trip verified   worst airline experience ever flew  people business class check in was a disaster the claimed i had exchanged tickets after  hours at the ticket counter we were given boarding passes we were group  but the delay caused us to board much later the connecting flight was cancelled leading to a day long layover with  children including an infant the ultimate connecting flight was also  hours late then they lost our luggage  days later they still dont have our luggage calling the helpline for lost luggage results in a  minute to  hour hold after which you are disconnected without speaking to anyone this airline is a complete disaster please do not fly them 
 trip verified   the crew ba on  june absolutely made this flight smooth journey with possibly the nicest crew ive ever had rebooking for september we were that impressed
 trip verified   i travelled on the th april with my baby in economy class flight ba  and ba  i had the pleasure of meeting sarah air stewardess she was absolutely amazing i received great service from her along with other staff but more importantly she went above and beyond it was hard enough travelling with an infant but her assistance throughout the flight was really appreciated she repeatedly asked if i needed anything as i had arham in my lap most of the time she held him whilst i had a cup of tea at the front of the aircraft we had a chat and the service was just amazing it is something i will never forget thank you for being there and for all your support throughout the flight i have worked in aviation but the job you do is remarkable and under appreciated hope you see this
 trip verified   outstanding inflight service from the crew friendly professional and helpful the very best of british even though the departure was delayed due to chaos among ground staff at vancouver it didnt matter the crew made the flight outstanding
 trip verified   recent trip to boston departing lhr t ground staff were absolutely fantastic and made an extra effort to make sure we were prepared for all the covid entry requirements in the us they were really friendly and personable very short queues for bag drop and security i would say it took us  minutes from kerbside to lounge which is fantastic considering what is going on in the uk at the moment boarding was very quick and efficient and was completed within  minutes seated on the last row of economy i really appreciated the low density  layout in economy compared to the  abreast seating myself and my colleague strategically booked the aisle seat either side of the centre and were lucky enough to have no one sat between us which really helped considering most of the foot space in these older seats is taken up by the ife box it really helped and would have been significantly less comfortable had we been sat next to each other the cabin crew were excellent well trained and personable they were very visible throughout the flight and proactively offered drinks outside of meal service meal service was very efficient with cabin crew proactively removing trays from people who had finished early something that you very rarely see in economy the food by doco was exceptional i dont think ive eaten so much on a transatlantic flight in economy it will be interesting to compare it on the return flight when its catered by an outstation overall it was a great flight helped by the additional space we had but nonetheless a good performance by ba which totally exceeded my expectations based on the reviews here and elsewhere i would definitely consider flying with them again
not verified   my son travelled alone for the first time to pursue his studies and we were very concerned about any issues he might have especially reading the reviews about the airlines but his flight was experience was good with no delays and reached toronto in time we are thankful to british airways to provide a hassle free flight to my son especially after the troubles the airlines have gone through due to pandemic unfortunately people with good experiences do not post their reviews skewing the reviews negatively the flight was very expensive though as we booked late after being dumped by air canada  swiss air after they cancelled their flight at the last moment
 trip verified   as a seasoned traveller and a loyal ba customer i am appalled at the companys recent drop in standards we were booked to fly from zhrlhr on a miles ticket in february  when we arrived at check in several hours before our scheduled departure we were informed that we would have to pay for our baggage even though our ticket clearly included free checked baggage we were held at check in for over an hour whilst the check in agent went to consult with her manager who then confirmed that we would have to pay to check in our baggage we have no option but to pay this charge however as a result of this delay at check in arrived at the gate to find that our flight had closed as this was the last flight of the day we were forced to find expensive overnight hotel accommodation i tried contact ba customer services after this incident on numerous occasion however they didnt bothered to respond at the rd attempt after i cc the ceo on my complaint i got a one line response saying that there was no free baggage included with our ticket at this point i got my solicitor to write a letter and they finally agreed to refund my baggage charge however they are refusing to compensate me for the missed flight and the considerable expenses and loss that i incurred as a result of their mistake
not verified   boarding on time but unfortunately from orts worst boarding gate which obviously was beyond bas control crew were good but lacked the personal touch old style ying yang business class with total lack of storage space and the  was showing its age however we were told the aircraft was being taken out of service the following week to be upgraded to the new club suites the cabin crew were good food ok wines a little disappointing overall a decent flight
 trip verified   flight delays can happen but the way ba handles such incidents in just way beyond our flight was delayed overnight our connecting flight was missed the overall delay resulted in more than  hours rechecking our bags took  hours standing in line a rebooking to an earlier connection was denied be it online or at the counter will certainly never fly ba again and do not recommend this airline
 trip verified   check in easy at bgi due to us checking flightradar and finding the flight was delayed by nearly  hours no notification from the airlines so other passengers arrived earlier easy boarding in sequence numbers seat is a joke for  hour flight no leg room on isle seat of  the seat in front frame blocks you stretching your legs and once the passenger in front reclines its even worse food is mediocre with poor choice and all of the drink choices had run out before the stewardess had arrived to my seat only choice cocacola water or red wine the connecting flight from lhr  man was cancelled with no contact from the airline i only found out trying to book a seat on the return legs with no alternative flight provided we had to privately book a taxi from lhr to manchester for  persons as this worked out cheaper than the train the outbound flight was also a farce no mention of terminal change at lhr from  to  so quick turnaround changing terminals was chaotic and stressful for older relatives travelling with us overall shocking from british airways and can guarantee i will never use them again
not verified   british airways  travel with confidence probably the most unsuitable tag line they should be ashamed back in october i booked a holiday to punta cana with ba only to have it cancelled early in  late last year i also booked heathrow to malaga for a family wedding in may guess what a few weeks ago that also got cancelled i had the chance to rebook with ba but with so many cancellations planned i was not willing to take the risk of not making my destination for such an important event so applied for and received a refund i have now also asked for my executive club account to be closed as i shall no longer be wasting my time booking with such a shambles of an airline my suggestion is if you want to travel with confidence choose another airline any airline
not verified   business class seating shown as a x configuration on the website is economy style with an unsold middle seat  not much more comfortable than economy meal service started with three options but was down to  options by row  out of  in business class and by row  where we were seated only one of us had  options then only grilled tofu was available for the rest of business class
 trip verified   we arrived  and half hours before our flight the queues to ba was terrible the airport security lines were not managed well the gate was closing as we arrived after jogging to the gate with asthma it was by far the worst travelling experience i have ever had that i have experienced all the airlines should put out a warning that you should arrive at least  hours before to have an enjoyable experience amsterdam is the worst airport i have experienced 
 trip verified   ba says that tickets are flexible and cancellation is free within  hrs that reality is an absolutely miserable alternative  hours after booking i need to change my flight i assume i will get a refund like their site says i will  that was apparently a lie they actually give me a voucher to request the voucher i have to sign away that i agree to the voucher despite not knowing how much money they will refund me and i might not get it for a week  i am panicked so i try calling them of course calling them does nothing the hotline says that they are too busy this happens again and again so i give up submit the request online despite no guarantee of amount or timing luckily it shows up quickly and i rebook then i need to change my booking again i go to request a voucher again this time the voucher code doesnt work on the website when i enter it so here i am needing to rebook with a useless voucher finally i call the executive class phone line which i am not a member of and then eventually pick up and agree to help me they do some thing on their back end and tell me that they will send the information to their booking department who will contact me in  hours
not verified   i have been battling a long overdue refund with ba regarding a flight originally booked in  the flight was cancelled a voucher was issued another flight was booked using this voucher and then again cancelled after trying to use the voucher for a new flight ba kept advising i couldnt as the voucher had been used i asked them to check the status of that flight as it never left and the agent advised she didnt have access to that information two years in i managed to speak to someone who recognised that either a voucher or refund was due and made a note on my record i then decided to pursue a refund as felt this would be less problematic ba have acknowledged they owe me a refund one phone call they said it will be with me in  working days i then chased when it was long overdue i was then told it will be with me in  working days the refund never came i try regularly to get through to customer service for the automated system to advise no agents are available i have also sent two follow up messages via the case reference link they sent me requesting an update but with no response honestly feel very let down by ba who up until this i felt were the more trustworthy and reliable airline i suspect they will have ruined many trusted relationships with customers by now
 trip verified   when i tried to check in they required a certificate of insurance for covid travel but i did not have it i tried for over  hours to get it issued but my bank where i had the travel insurance the department that could issue the certificate was closed it was  after a very long time i got a cover letter which the bank sent to me but then to be told i had missed the check in by  minutes they would not let me board and i missed the flight so i contacted ba and tried to rebook another departure flight only to be told that because i missed my departing flight my return flight had automatically been cancelled and this was ba policy so then they worked out a new price to book the flights but now the price was  i originally paid  for the flights i then did a search on google and found flights for  flying out with air mauritius and returning with ba on the same flight i was originally supposed to return on unfortunately ba had made me miss  days of my holiday i searched for over an hour but could not find anywhere on ba site that i needed the insurance document when i checked in for the mauritius airways flight they did not ask for the insurance document and i had a lovely flight with no issues every time i fly with ba i have a bad experience and i promise i will never fly with them again 
 trip verified   another dreadful mediocre experience with ba to malaga this time boarding was by bus and to a remote stand with no aircon then on flight the the wifi was erratic and guests couldnt order food or drinks then the card payment system didnt work so we gave up on ordering finally at malaga we were held up and not allowed to leave the plane as the bags had to come off first in case we caused the plane to go unbalanced really its all one excuse after another with ba these days
not verified  basel to johannesburg via london cancelled connection flight confusing ui still shows cancelled booking in my bookings never sent a confirmation email for new flights  cant checkin could checkin online or via the app customer service is nonexistent busy line after min still no one there to help me check in
 trip verified   very low standards for club europe there was no cabin divider in the aircraft so no privacy or separate cabin as would be expected aircraft not properly cleaned in athens there was full rubbish bag left in the seat pocket no inflight information as the in flight maps have long disappeared from european routes which is a shame staff was attentive though and tried their best
 trip verified   this flight was not affected by recent problems with ba and i was quite impressed by the british airways premium economy product in a new boeing  overall premium economy turned out to be premium and clearly a step up from economy towards business class also the premium economy product came across much better in the boeing  than in the old b or even than in the b seat was very comfortable and had nice leg room food service and entertainment options were good clearly worth the extra money for premium economy
not verified   british airways continues to decline in customer service i used to love this airline and now i have had three poor experiences back to back regarding their customer service on the phone with flight changes and vouchers the most recent experience has cost me  more than originally booked due to bad rep advice and multiple calls to the company even as part of the executive club silver i continue to be left on hold for ages and in the last week have spent over  hours on the phone seeking support at this rate they have lost my trust
not verified   on my flight from lax to lhr i paid to pick my seat for my flight back to lax i saw the  come out of my account the next day as im adding in my booking the day before my flight the website tells me i no longer have a booked seat and the seat i paid for has been sold to someone else i spent an hour trying to find a way to contact their customer service and at first was told to dm the airline on twitter which i find extremely inappropriate but i still reached out anyway because i was unable to find another way to contact them on twitter i was told they were looking for an agent to help me and they never ended up responding they just left my message unread after about  hours of waiting for a twitter dm back i ended up being able to find a chat line on their website while talking to the agent on the chat line she informed me that they sold my seat to another customer and that she would book me a new seat however she was unable to tell me where the seat was or how many people were in my row after a frustrating conversation she was able to book me my original seat soon after i tried to pull up my booking in the british airways app and was unable to find it i would enter the booking reference and the site would say it was a success and the booking would show up once i refreshed the page but it did not i continued to try and add the booking and the app would do the same thing every time say it was a success then never add the booking im not able to find the chat line again and i will not dm a company on twitter with my support issues again im extremely frustrated
 trip verified  amazing flight and comfortable the premium economy seats have been upgraded with a leg rest new aircraft staff very friendly and professional the food was great beyond expectation
 trip verified   i booked a flight to london and paid months in advance to upgrade my seat to an isle side exit row front of the cabin  more legroom upon checkin my expensive upgrade had been given away to someone else and i was left to choose a miserable middle seat near the toilet i spent an entire afternoon calling customer service if my call went through at all the automated system simply hangs up when it decides they are too busy i was placed on indefinite hold replete with elevator music and an insincere guarantee that my call mattered i was greeted by someone with a heavy accent over a very low quality hard to hear line i am  and not deaf sometimes they would purposely hang up before i said anything other times they would purposely hang up after i stated my plight if i managed to persist through all of that for hours on end they would hang up purposely after needing to put me on hold once more to speak with their supervisor in the end ba managed to swindle me for hundreds of dollars and i booked with another airline on principle 
not verified   we are on our way home after a  week holiday in the uk and have had all  flights with british airways our  internal flights between london and edinburgh were great due to the friendly staff and there were no complications however the  long haul flights have been a nightmare our initial flight from cape town to heathrow was a full flight the staff seemed very overwhelmed they ran out of certain food and drinks and as we were in economy right at the back we got the leftovers my entertainment system was also not working we are about to board the return flight from heathrow to cape town and the check in process was horrific i had booked through expedia and somehow my return flight did not have a checked in bag allowance which i didnt realise until we checked in i ended up having to pay an additional  for my bag after being told to try do it under manage my booking on the app which was not possible and i also spent  minutes on hold trying to get through to the ba customer service number with no luck we asked to speak to someone is person in terminal  and were told that they have no customer service desk in the main ba terminal  overall it took us about  hours to get me checked in after speaking to about  different staff members none of which could help me there was also a discrepancy with the baggage allowance as my friend i am traveling with was allowed kg and after paying to add my bag i was told it was overweight as i was only allowed kg and the bag was kg compared to having flown with other airlines i will never fly with ba again the level of service is shocking compared to what you would expect
 trip verified   i would like to thank you for the great service i am a handicap and my family and i were afraid of this trip because i was flying alone and had a layover in london of a few hours i had to change terminals and everything but thanks to a great service my trip was amazing they took great care of me and made sure i was doing well throughout the whole flight
 trip verified  i connected into madrid on iberia and wrote a scathing review of their awful long haul business class service british airways short haul business class was in a totally different class the cabin had  rows of seats in bc a record for me the staff met us at the door in a very cheerful way and this was a sign of the highly professional way they would continue to look after us throughout the flight the messaging from cabin crew and flight crew was excellent the food was first class nothing was too much for the staff why oh why can two members of the same company offer such different levels of sift and hard service my thought is that it must be ingrained in the ethics of the company british airways keep up the good work it would be better if you had proper business class seats like some of your european competitors overall you made me feel proud to be a brit
not verified   we flew from dubrovnik to heathrow on the th april  check in was very fast and we cleared security in about  minute we made our way up to the lounge which just has the basic essentials but was clean and spacious when boarding time came we had priority boarding and was the first few to board welcomed by the cabin crew and given wipes once seated we left more or less on tme had the safety brief taxiing for take off once airborne it was soon time for the drinks and meal services choice of  main meal options which was very good served by very friendly crew the captain kept us informed about the progress of the journey arrived at heathrow slightly early overall a very pleasant trip we will be flying again with british airways
 trip verified   i have always chosen to not make a big deal of the poor service delays dirty aircraft over packed lounges cabin crew etc experienced over the years but have lost all patience with this airline having paid almost k extra to change our return flight for the family to get a flight at a specific time ba cancelled this and placed us on another flight almost  hours later there was no option to get any of the other available flights the business class lounge at lhr was packed with hardly any space to move the aircraft was filthy with food wrapping papers on my seat and floor the seats were uncomfortable food for business class passengers included bread rolls passed in a basket the poor level of hygiene overcrowding delays cancellations makes this the worst airline i have had to endure 
 trip verified  business lounge was closed at pisa airport which was probably beyond the control of british airways but as it had been closed since january the least british airways could have done would have issued their customers who paid for this service vouchers to be used at the airport i complained about this to ba and as compensation they said they would credit my account with  avios points which i felt was an adequate compensation and at that point felt ba had handled the situation in a prompt and professional manner however that was seven weeks ago and no avios points have been added to my account i have called their call centre multiple times at one point being put on hold for an hour to put through to the right department when the phone was answered i was told it was the wrong department and to phone a number which was read out to me which was the same number i was calling this scenario has replayed itself probably about twenty times now it is clear that ba have no intention of resolving this and are just making their customer go round in circles before they give up this airline is absolutely appalling in the way it treats its customers
not verified   our good friday flight was delayed by hours std  atd  to durban south africa from johannesburg there were no announcements made when approached no time frame was given they simply didnt know an aircraft had to be towed from a hanger at johannesburg crew arrived late the aircraft was filthy we shall never fly comair again that includes kulula or ba absolutely shocking service
not verified   we had a trip with  flights included all  flights were delayed the worst with hmin also one flight was cancelled and we were rebooked to a h earlier flight loosing h of our short vacation no explanation or compensation was given for the cancelled flights or delays i expected a lot better as i have earlier used ba with good results this was a really bad experience and i will avoid using ba for any further travels
not verified   my first time in the new club world suite excellent lots of space and privacy very good seat i doubt if this can be bettered good staff as ever my only quibble is that the food is all served at once ba needs to roll this out quickly
 trip verified   i had an incredible rude check in staff at the british airways counter in nice on th april  zero empathy towards me a struggling customer second situation happened when we arrived into nice terminal  on ba  april where my luggage did not make it on the same flight as me and had to put my details down for delivery when our luggage arrived at nice airport the day after and received an email from the avia partner lost and found british airways partner at pm informing us that our luggage has now arrived in nice after multiple emails back and forth with emphasis on we were strongly expressing that i did not have clothes or shoes to wear and that we only had  short days in monaco it was vital we received the luggage asap the lady replied if it is so important why dont you come and pick it up here at the airport or send your driver to pick it up despite the fact that a proper delivery address was supplied to them from the very beginning this has been an appalling experience
 trip verified   we booked a business class flight with qantas from melbourne to glasgow via london as qantas fly to heathrow british airways is their partner airline so we were automatically booked on ba from heathrow to glasgow we booked this flight in october however  days before we were due to leave we received an email from british airways advising that our flight from heathrow to glasgow has been cancelled to help us out the email said they had however booked us on another flight leaving from london city airport which is  miles from heathrow airport and the flight is going to edinburgh not glasgow not sure how we were supposed to get from glasgow additionally it is in economy not business class even though we had booked business class originally we booked this as one connecting flight so british airways know that we have just travelled  hours from australia there was no mention in the email about compensation for the change of class or additional travel costs in getting to another airport nothing about possibly not accepting the flight given it was obviously never going to work for us and no contact details for british airways they also sent the email on good friday so even when i did eventually find a contact number their office was closed i have never experienced such terrible customer service with any airline i have ever flow on and i can guarantee i will never fly british airways again 
not verified   the service was very good the cabin crew were very kind and the boarding was very quick for an aircraft of this size the seat was comfortable for economy and because the a walls are still expanding outwards on the first floor there was a lot of space the food was good for airplane food the only bad thing was the ife screen was quite outdated and wasnt good quality however there was a large selection of movies and tv shows
" trip verified   total chaos for departures immigration at malaga airport boarding was quick polite welcome by cabin crew beverage cart after take off was prompt followed by lunch with a choice of  entrees food can best be described as wholesome but not meeting quality levels of air france swiss or lufthansa short haul business class meals menu is still missing and like many other aspects of the experience ba cut a lot during covid and have not reintroduced i wouldnt mind but on european trips in  ba are charging up to  times the fare levels of  and the overall value for money is now very poor the wifi did not work from start to finish of the flight crew said it had worked on the way out and the captain had contacted london to get it fixed on the return ba is becoming more and more shambolic blaming far too much on covid and it is time they took some responsibility for their failings
"
not verified   shout out to the help desk at heathrow we arrived to late to make our flight and the lady with  years exp was great she had a tough crowd to deal with and was very kind and helpful in getting us a place to stay food to eat and a flight home the next day
not verified   i am constantly amazed how british airways continue to get things wrong  i pretty much though they had covered all those bases and in the last  years living in the uk i have watched their decline with great sadness my flight to paris was no exception not only was the flight late overcrowded and not managed at all by disinterested staff  that we sat on the tarmac full boarded for one hour while we waited for catering to be loaded on front and then back left me gobsmacked as they barely offer any food service anyway small packet of crisps and an even smaller bottle of water on a  minute flight i wondered why they thought it was good operational planning to delay a whole plane load of passengers so that  people in business class could speedily eat a poor quality meal on the flight to paris as it transpired i was over  minutes late and missed the meeting i was flying to paris to attend never again
 trip verified   the short haul flights were the best with the crew on the final leg giving the excellent service that we all hope for we chose out flights very carefully so that we were booked on flights with the club world suits not the ying yang arrangement that they still offer at the last minute the aircraft was changed so we had to put up with the ying yang which really should have been pensioned off ages ago most business class offer  across but this layout still squeezes in  across as we only take one long haul leisure trip a year in business class we always lose out on the points game but i take exception to having paid in full on a non refundable basis not to be allowed to reserve my seats the points gained from this trip alone would have allowed us bronze status but we were not given this status until after the trip when it is useless to us this status would have allowed us to book the seats  days prior to departure when they were still available rather than the  hours when they were not available on the long haul return flight i was unable to book a window seat but on boarding after the doors had closed there was a window seat still vacant i asked if i could move and was told by the fa she would check nothing happened but after takeoff a passenger was moved from economy to that seat judging by the interaction between them i would bet it was someone on staff travel i think it disgraceful that a full fare paying passenger should be treated like this takeoff was just after  hrs but we were not offered a drinks service before supper but were told we could order a drink that would be delivered on out tray with the meal had we done this our meal would have been cold by the time we ate it in summary would i ever fly with ba again no not if i had half a chance of going with another airline 
 trip verified   a very comfortable new suite flight with great service and good food crew was wonderful new seat is great except the shoulder strap is very uncomfortable entertainment great wifi was annoying cutting off and needing constant reconnecting generally a positive experience
 trip verified  british airways is the most terrible airline ive dealt with they have caused our family extreme stress and disappointment  we have tried for a week now to speak to someone as we cant make the changes online they hang up on you every time you call them  we have been driven to despair by their treatment of their customers you cant check in online the application sucks so much youre better off trying to code your own app and itll probably work better every time you try to check in you are taken to a page that says we cant verify your documents yet the app and website say youre verified and ready to go you upgrade and pay for upgrade and it says its guaranteed and then when you go to check in which you have to go to the airport for because online wont work they give you a different seat than you paid for and a lower class and offer nothing in return  i hope i never have the misfortune of getting stuck flying with british airways ever again
 trip verified   british airways is the most terrible airline ive ever dealt with they have caused our family extreme stress and disappointment  we have tried for a week now to speak to someone as we cant make the changes online they hang up on you every time you call them  we have been driven to despair by their treatment of their customers i have no choice but to cancel our chance of a life time trip wed booked with our   year old boys as they were flying with another airline and would have been alone in japan as ba just cancelled our trip and we cannot rebook online as the trip was booked with avios and companion vouchers
not verified   ba is getting a real bashing on this forum and i thought id buck the trend and report a virtually flawless experience of a short hop from edi to lcy on ba this monday easy check in decent lounge experience except the very amiable staff were still forced to serve from behind barriers very clean plane which left on time ridiculous amount of legroom in d it is a bulkhead seat but with lots more space than a or c reasonable cooked breakfast served by a very attentive and capable csm and arrived  mins earlier than scheduled whats not to like which is my overall experience with the vast majority of my ba experiences over the last  years anyway i thought it would be nice to read a positive review for once
not verified   new club suites are amazing the only let down is the bed is a little too firm but the pillow was the most comfortable pillow i have ever used food was ok as i have had better on ba in the past and i can understand why they put everything on a single tray which is ok the cabin crew were brilliant but i was surprised that after dinner the crew didnt once come round with beverages or even bottled water ba really have a great hard product here and i would suspect the soft product will improve once covid restrictions become less of an issue well done ba
 trip verified  very small plane for a busy route service was good but food not so ran out of a lot and options left were not good cabin crew for ba actually really friendly
 trip verified   ba continue to charge a premium for the most disgusting service provided by people who shouldnt be in customer service on tired dirty and cramped aircraft out of  flights this year not one has managed to depart or arrive at their destinations ontime including having  business class tickets cancelled and an alternative in economy being offered still no refunds  months on and had a flight late and missed connection so ba cancelled the rest of my ticket leaving me stranded in the us 
 trip verified   flew back on ba bridgetown to heathrow in the old club class a huge disappointment after going out in the new club class suites  the end of this awful yin and yang seating cant come soon enough even tried to pay bas extortionate prebooking rate for our seats  none left to choose even weeks ahead my wife and i were stuck in the middle  seats of   e and f good job it was an overnighter so we managed to sleep a bit and not have to climb over our neighbours very often the march film selection so not good not particularly friendly fa who insisted face masks must be worn even though bas policy has changed regarding flying back to a nonmask wearing destination ie london sort it out ba took off  minutes late but big tailwind so more than made up the time on a relatively smooth flight dinner not to bad but breakfast  fairly dire my wifes smoked salmon bagel was dreadful as usual when ba is good its really good but when its bad its awful i recommend hesitatingly  come on ba be great again we pay a lot for premium seats
not verified   the worst budget airline ive ever used far worse than ryanair and i refuse to fly with them even though theyre basically free ba charge about x as much as other budgets but have the worst service spent an hour checking in because their outdated computers crashed they left us sat on the plane for over  hours because they couldnt connect to the internet then left  of our luggage behind because they would have had to refund everyones flights if they waited another  mins for the other luggage trolleys to arrive it took three days to return it and cost us s then on return ive now been sat here nearly two hours and theres no sign of our luggage again i dont know how a company can be this incompetent but ill be pursuing for compensation i have some free flights from amex but i wont be using them because its not worth going through this again
 trip verified  first the actual flights are fine and the staff on all  flights zrhlhr gvalhr  lhrzrh first  in economy are absolutely fine chatty and friendly they are a credit to the company the infrastructure however is appalling zrhlhr impossible to checkin online and just  staff to checkin everyone for  flights resulting in mislabelled luggage and an hour delay to sort this out gvalhr hrs late as noone at lhr to tow the aircraft to the gate lhrzrh mins late due to slow gate staff even when you checkin online you have to queue at the airport to get the actual boarding pass there are more examples and for this reason until they sort out their stressed ground staff it is impossible to recommend this airline onboard  getting to be onboard 
 trip verified   have not flown economy with ba for years what a shock hard uncomfortable seats small aged tv screens with limited inflight entertainment food and service appalling hr plus flight no socks eye shades ear plug amenity pack and no antibacterial wipes offered wifi advertised but not available on flight paid premium money for a budget airline more akin to easy jet ryanair or jetstar my last time travelling with ba after more than  years of flying with them ba you really do need to buck up your service and become the flagship service you used to be
 trip verified   flew to barbados  march on ba  in the new club class suite a huge improvement on the old yin and yang club class which we unfortunately endured on the way back comfortable big tv screen with high quality picture and good headphones plenty of nooks and crannies for storing small items and very private nice friendly fas called by my name from the off and pretty good drinks service with a good dinner served once again let down by a poor at best choice of movies on the inflight entertainment system thank goodness the latest james bond movie was showing took off and landed on time smooth flight only one letdown  the usual extortionate fee charged for prebooking a seat come on ba stop nickel and diming  it spoils what could be a really good business class product and after all we already pay quite a bit for the privilege i recommend with the usual caveats
not verified   very poor flight from cape town to london after the chaos of cape town airport passenger handling with incredibly long queues to get through security and then passport control taking nearly two hours in total we arrived at the lounge somewhat frazzled and were very happy to find a quiet area with decent wine and appropriate food choices for a break before boarding the flight boarding went well and we were seated and offered a small half full glass of champagne the captain made an announcement to say that we were all aboard ahead of schedule and that the flight time would be shorter than scheduled but unfortunately this would mean our arrival would be too early to land due to the  am lifting of the overnight jet ban at heathrow so we would have to wait on the ground for perhaps half an hour or so this was no big deal then the captain announced that due to it issues at heathrow they could get not compile necessary paperwork so we would be delayed for an indefinite period with the delay of uncertain duration one might have hoped for a further offering of champagne or other beverage in particularly for business class but this was not forthcoming in the event take off was permitted quite soon after the crew had distributed menus but then did a pa to say that there were changes to each of the main courses a drinks order was taken for pre dinner drinks for main course for dinner and choice of wine with dinner drinks and nuts were served circa  minutes after take off in my case a small measure of white wine in the bottom of a pleasant and decent sized tumbler and my husband had another half glass of champagne dinner arrived on a single tray with a small measure of red wine in the tumbler the food looked bland unappetising and tasted the more so the cheese two small pieces were sitting in a greasy pool of vinegary chutney no top up of the wine was offered we did ask for a second glass and it was provided on a very individualised basis and coffee was not served since we had hit some mild turbulence the flight was some  hours in duration and no other snacks or beverages were offered prior to breakfast which was provided separately to each passenger as they showed signs of being awake breakfast was slightly more edible than dinner coffee or tea were offered by individual mug orange juice was available on request cabin crew were largely absent from the cabin except during the meal services but it must be said that they were extremely pleasant and were suitably responsive to requests for individual items come on british airways you can and need to do better than this if you are to meet customer expectations and compete with other airlines on similar routes for the cost of a business class ticket passengers are enjoying only additional space and seat comfort flatbed as a benefit over an economy ticket at or below  of the price paid for the premium cabin time was when flying in business class was real treat no longer is this the case
not verified   our main complaint is that the limited food served was bland barely edible and by far the worst weve ever experienced compared to other airlines used in the past the staff were friendly enough but they were rarely seen between meals no snacks were offered during the flight this is so different to every other airline we have used in the past after  hours of flying the breakfast offered was a tiny cold stale ham and cheese roll and a small plain yoghurt with a couple of oreos if ever you decide to fly with them i suggest that you bring your own food we certainly will on our return flight but will never use british airways again
 trip verified   complete and utter chaos at heathrow yet again surely the ceo sean doyle must now take responsibility and step aside for the consistent and continuous it problems that cause flights to be cancelled and delayed the queue for the first wing check in at am today was over  hour and subsequent flight to malaga  hrs late leaving the gate updated about the delays  times but strangely not one person apologised or said sorry  ba seems to think this is normal practice nowadays as emerald oneworld i wish there was an alternative because ba has become intolerable and this is after flying them for  years since beaboac days
not verified   feb   we show up at the airport  hours early for our flight to dublin we waited in line for  hours to just check in our luggage after that we learn our flight is delayed another  hours we had a connecting flight in london when trying to go through customs they wouldnt let us through because the boarding of the plane was going to be happening in  minutes they told us to wait in a customer service line that was well over an hour we then found out we could have gone through customs because the connecting flight from london to dublin was delayed over an hour however by the time we were told this information the doors were about to close the next available flight to dublin was  late evening with that being said we were forced to stay the night in london after talking to a british airways manager they informed us that ba would reimburse us for any hotel flight to get to dublin regardless of the airline clothes due to them losing our bags excursions and transportation due to this issue we had to spend multiple days shopping for clothes lost out on days we had booked to explore the country had to now buy an extra suitcase for the new clothes we received went  days with lost bags when we finally got home we submitted our claims like we were told to do within a few days its declined we have asked for a contact  just to talk to somebody again declined we tried to reach out via social media and we get passiveaggressive messages  they refuse to pay me back for the new flight to get to dublin transportation to and from the airport in london the hotel for london the clothes i had to buy because they lost my bags for  days and the extra luggage fee because of the extra clothes i had to buy there is no customer support and they are impossible to get a direct response from
 trip verified   british airways are in the process of upgrading all its  fleet to the new club suite but ba had the yrsold packedlikesardines club world product the lounge at cpt was also bursting at the seams and food orders were so behind that many passengers had left by the time their food arrived on boarding we were surprised to find that the menu amenity kit and bottle of water had already been placed in the storage drawer we suspect this is another cynical timesaving initiative on the part of ba frustratingly the menu turned out to be incorrect and the replacement dishes were probably the worst we have ever encountered in any business class on any airline the drinks run was cancelled without any warning on the spurious basis of a passenger with a nut allergy its hard to avoid suspicions that cabin crew were being economical with the truth apart from a rather turbulent ride the flight was otherwise uneventful and arrival was slightly ahead of schedule baggage handling was however atrociously slow
 trip verified   we flew to funchal madeira yesterday madeira has no covid restrictions for entry yet ba asked us to upload our nhs vaccination passes before we could check in online i received an ok about an hour later but my husband did not so i couldnt check in online we arrive at heathrow  hours before departure and stood in a long queue for check in there were just  desks open for a queue of approx  travellers then several people went on breaks or disappeared so we were down to one desk open with the queue barely moving i went to complain to various ba staff who said the manager had been told and more people were coming one blonde lady walked around for ages shepherding travellers into the queue before sitting down at a desk another man later did likewise making us wonder why they hadnt simply worked at the desks from the beginning all in all we stood in that queue for a good hour before almost running to the security queue which thankfully moved quickly then we hurriedly bought a sandwich walked to our departure gate and stood on the bus to the plane the whole experience was extremely stressful and took the best part of  hours we did not have time to sit down until we did so on the plane and completely unnecessary if we had been able to check in online this would not have happened my husbands vaccination pass is fine but not required for madeira i think it is a systems failure as he received an email yesterday morning saying his pass was not in order as did i even though id previously been told i could check in online also unnecessary as if ba had staffed the desks properly the queue would have moved a staff member told us ba had laid off lots of staff during lock down and was now begging them to return but having been treated badly they didnt want to the flight itself was fine on time we were given a bag of crisps and a bottle of water again fine nothing praise worthy
 trip verified   absolutely bad experience with  british airways i have two bookings with them for the past two years both were cancelled the first one i understand  covid unexpected but today i got another surprise my flight to antalya in may  was cancelled and no explanation is given i will definitely not book ever again with them
not verified   flew ba lhraus on a  on the outbound leg and then back on the a on the return leg seats comfortable staff service on the inbound leg was disappointing safety briefing was missed on lhraus route lhraus boarding on time flight flew out on time landed on time auslhr boarding one hour late left an hour late and landed one hour late too food quality on both legs was not fit for human consumption wife ordered a veg meal which was served cold on both legs in flight entertainment on outbound leg was bad   screens not working on return leg worked fine but this is due to the a being brand new good quality of sleep on both legs which was good check in at lhr was flawless and without incident check in at aus was rotten we queued and were number  in line and waited for  hour for staff to check us in what was clear is staff quality in austin is poor passengers did not appear to have passenger locator forms ready  verifly app ready and  or vaccine detail ready having looked at business and premium economy class on both legs paying business class and premium economy did not appear worth it baggage was received fine at aus and lhr  the latter took ages on return if i had the option of another airline  i would not fly ba
not verified   the food was awful an over night early morning flight started with the offer of a terrible chicken wrap thing terrible then went to a traditional breakfast with disgusting sausage and inedible hash browns such rubbish on ba
 trip verified  i really cant believe they have the audacity to call this first class the check in staff at singapore were abrupt and unhelpful the official ba lounge in singapore was closed so theyre using a cheap generic alternative which anyone can pay twenty pounds to go in suffice to say it was not pleasant onboard was like being in the middle of a bad comedy sketch i can not believe the two stewardess have ever had any first class training i had to ask for slippers the first drink took nearly an hour to arrive despite only having  passengers to serve between the two of them the poor woman sat next to me ordered a wine which came filled to the brim i mean its first class not a student house party neither had any knowledge of the wines on the menu most of the food was awful my steak was dry over cooked and tough and whichever catering manger signed off on a canap of soggy mushroom on top of a chunk of polenta should be sacked immediately i will say the cheese and port were nice however the worst thing was the constant galley noise there was a cart stowage immediately in front of my seat k which they were in and out of all night and appeared incapable of shutting without slamming they also seemed to have stored their personal belongings in to the bin immediately above my seat so were in and out of that as well i will say the seat itself is very well designed but personally im happy in club and would never do first again
 trip verified   london to dubai family of  kids where from  down to  years old savvy travelers been on many holidays so we were excited to be on ba for first time but disappointment became desperation as we had not eaten anything since dublin that morning at am we had no time to eat at lhr so thought well get something usually around  hour into the flight  hours after take off they served out food food was fine but nothing special no issues with beverage no attention to kids as youd expect from many other airlines even a kids book would be good movies are all outdated and already watched so overall very medium experience
 trip verified  one would think that the number of crises ba incurs they would have had emergency planning down to a fine art i last flew with ba may   yes the weekend of the last but one it crisis i swore never again but ended up purchasing a ticket aug  to bologna  ba cancelled the flight then covid hit so ended up with a voucher fast forward to feb th  received a message am mins from lhr that that my flight was cancelled arrived at the airport with everyone else just wandering and seeking answers the staff that were there either told you to go online  a bit difficult as the ba systems were down or ring ba ha ha or go home  not very helpful if you live two hours from lhr by some miracle the app sprung into life and i managed to get one of the last  seats on the evening flight sat in arrivals as there was a coffee shop  soon ran out of seats by  midday most of us were trying to get airside to use lounges but no one was allowed in departures until two hours prior to your flight supposedly because of crowds pointed out ba should have provided refreshments  told to put a claim in eventually got to departures and made it through security ba customer services note the oxymoron  had a consistent queue of about  people as ba were still cancellingrearranging flights for passengers who were airside boarded flight mins late sat on tarmac as the pilot told us the delay was them trying to reconcile luggage when we took off given one very small bottle of water and a cereal bar for a fivehour flight they purport to be a topclass airline but in fact ryanair has more finesse the staff are fine but can be miserable because they are treated so badly and like to remind you that they are doing their best in a difficult situation  well so are the passengers the aircraft are cramped and worn i had been reluctant to use egyptair but flew home with them on a new aircraft with a very good entertainment system and was provided with a hot meal and snack for same price as a ba ticket how on earth can ba justify their prices the management should be sacked as ultimately they are to blame for the ruination of this airline
not verified   we will never use ba again for a long haul flight our experience of the flight from lhrmle wasnt too bad apart from a screaming child but the return wasnt a good experience we werent provided with a drink when we boarded as we were forgotten and that happened a few more times during the flight i think the crew in premium economy were very young and not very experienced leaving the experienced ones in businessfirst actually i think ba only care about the businessfirst customers now with the cabins getting larger for those classes they ran out of food choice  rows back in our cabin its not a large cabin ran out of wine straight after the food service and we had no food for hrs apart from a couple of biscuits one of those we had to go and get from the kitchen we werent fed until hrs before we landed it was a hr flight and then it was a soggy roll containing  slices or cucumber and  slices of tomato ba just dont care anymore about the little people
 trip verified   british airways is getting worse an worse my flight was  mins late luggage is taking hours to arrive  no communication whatsoever from anyone they cant be reached on the phone and answer with delays to emails if they do my app is crashing most of the times they change the aircraft without notice so even if you pay for a seat the staff will say there is nothing they can do
 trip verified  paid for  business class seats to london from new york got downgraded at airport check in because they overbooked business class couldnt even provide compensation or a refund told i had to call customer service or submit a form unbelievable unacceptable never again 
 trip verified   absolutely shambolic customer service the lounges at heathrow are outdated and the service was terrible waited over an hour for my chosen fooddrink order to be brought to me ended up getting it myself and told off for doing so on board product is average 
 trip verified   our flight back to athens on a different airline was very delayed causing us to miss our first flight home i understand that they were not required to help due to the delayed flight being a different airline whats worse is that they went ahead and canceled our tickets for our connecting flight which we would have been able to make based on another flight out we found causing us to have to buy much more expensive tickets home that resulted in us having an overnight layover and having to buy a hotel room on top of ridiculously expensive last minute tickets the absolute worst customer service i have ever dealt with and i will never be flying with them again
 trip verified   flight took off two hours late after what can only be described as a shambles at the airport no airbridge to the aircraft which is not acceptable the aircraft was better than the outbound flight who screen was so small after serving only about rd of the cabin no first choice only a vegetarian dish or a chicken dish from the economy cabin the airline must know that vegetarians will order a meal so why include it as a choice also to offer a roll of hamcheese for breakfast after a  hour flight is cost saving a hot breakfast should be offered with only  minutes between my connecting flight due to late arrival i made staff aware whilst they let me and others passengers of the flight first there was no staff to assist in getting us to our flight it was a struggle to get my connecting flight on arriving in glasgow got txt to say my bags did not make the flight first time using ba premium and likely my last
 trip verified   there was a mistake on my booking made by ba got an email to say contact us to discuss took over  contact attempts spanning  hours and still not resolved absolutely the most shambolic customer support i have ever experienced still waiting for the call back i was promised  weeks ago
 trip verified  the economy cabin was surprisingly underpopulated on this flight with only about  passengers but business class was threequarters full boarding was therefore mercifully quick and takeoff on schedule sadly ba makes use of the old club world product which now seems like a step back in time after experiencing the new club suite on ba there are some good points about the old club world  the drawer capable of taking a laptop and the more comfortable seat when flat  but other than those its an embarrassment the tiny poorly responsive screen is almost beyond belief service was perfunctory and the meal service conformed to the current overly cautious postcovid requirements with everything served at the same time this does mean that the meal is over and done with relatively speedily but its a lacklustre experience in contrast to bas competitors and smacks of continued costcutting queues for the three toilets in business class were unacceptable at times and there was limited attention paid to keeping them clean arrival was on schedule but covid paperwork processing meant that it was an hour before we were able to collect our baggage
 trip verified   british airways continues to go downhill we flew business class and the experience was like economy from  years ago except you can have a glass of champagne we were packed in full x seats because of it issue the day before even if werent the seat pitch and width is the same as economy gone are the little pretend tables in the middle seat to give some illusion of style the food was dreadful the in flight service was unsophisticated ba used to have an acceptable european business class they dont any more other european airlines offer much better in flight experience in business class in comparison ba is taking premium and frequent flyers for granted and treating us like mugs how i miss the politeness of old ba business class from around  years ago how i used to look forward to it the small gestures like hanging up a coat giving you a hot towel having nice food being served from the galley rather than from the manky trolley covid is not the reason  this is years of cost cutting and the result is dreadful
 trip verified   outstanding from the warm smiling welcome on board this flight was excellent the in flight crew were friendly attentive and very professional detailed announcements from the flight deck as well food and wine all very good indeed the premium economy product on ba is also very good comfortable seats foot and leg rests and decent recline fr superior to any other airline on other atlantic routes
 trip verified   british airways has scrapped the mandatory wearing of face masks onboard flights although they pretend publicly that the policy remains ba from london to malaga on th february and across  visible rows around me there were  out of  passengers wearing face masks  and i was one of them this was long after the meal  drinks service had been cleared and remained like that as we landed and deplaned cabin crew were frequently up and down the aisles and not a word was said to any of these non compliant passengers or as they left the aircraft with staff bidding them farewell i guess they are too scared to remind people to follow the rules 
 trip verified   for once more ba got it all wrong with  hours delay food voucher of  pounds and no information or advice no staff to serve the waiting passengers the attitude towards the passenger is one of a dispensable commodity
not verified   another episode of unmitigated shambles when it comes to customer service the day after storm eunice and english half term holidays are getting underway so you make allowances and you accept there could be some delays the fact they were then compounded by the late cancellation of a raft of flights to domestic and european destinations on the evening of saturday  february for operational reasons was pitiful you could not rebook via bas website instead passengers were compelled to queue at gate a at lhr to possibly rebook and be provided with accommodation overnight some ba cabin crew were helpful but those in customer services in the south lounge who simply directed passengers to the ever growing queues at a were a disgrace
 trip verified   check in at iad was quick and easy lounge in washington was a ba lounge and very good sound pre flight food offerings for this overnight flight flight on time and boarded promptly as we had eaten we opted to sleep there was full dinner and breakfast service for those that wanted it we slept well on time arrival and quickly made it to t arrivals lounge which was excellent
 trip verified   very old planes poor food and minimal leg room in economy check in procedure online did not work for me or any of my fellow travellers special meal request given weeks in advance for food allergy was ignored i spoke to a ba customer service representative as soon as i landed in heathrow who said they could not help and referred to the telephone line who said the same but referred to the online complaints form have been trying for weeks to raise this as a concern for those with food allergies and prevent this from happening to others but no reply via their complaints website or on twitter telephone hotline is now also currently unavailable
not verified  having just booked ba for a return flight  being one hour each way in club class and paying   euro for  persons to be then asked to pay a further  euro to choose seats in business a full business class ticket and a fee for seat a very disengaged management model
 trip verified   ba got everything right allowed evening before check in  this allowed lots of time for staff to help with paperwork needed for travel to the us on the day of travel it was half term and the airport busy in spite of this through security and into lounge in  minutes lounge clean staff proactive and food served quickly good range of drinks easy transfer to c gates aircraft ready boarding quick and well organised pre departure drinks served the cabin crew were excellent and provided a very good service the food was the new club world menu options  roast beef which was excellent although it was the older club world product it was clean and well maintained on time arrival baggage off very fast overall an excellent flight and it feels like ba are improving their offering at a time when many other providers use covid as an excuse for service cut backs well done
 trip verified   appalling customer service  they have cancelled flights and rebooked us but have not confirmed any change to the hotel reservation that was part of the inclusive booking hours and hours on the telephone with no response or you just get a recorded message to say they cant take the call they dont respond to emails sent to the complaints line 
 trip verified   this past novemberdecember i flew washingtonlondon return and on the strength of that trip my first in two years the inflight service quality appears to have pretty much returned to the prepandemic status quo ante the cabin was clean and well maintained seats were comfortable food and drinks were good including a very tasty hertfordshire roast pork on the return leg and the ba cabin crews remain the best in the business this was one of a number of bookings that i had to rebook a number of times due to flight cancellations and contrary to the experience of many here my rebookings were handled courteously and thoroughly although i did have a number of lengthy waits on hold but under the present circumstances thats to be expected its good to see that the everyday product has held up so well amid this dreadful time and im looking forward to future trips on ba
 trip verified   i had the best experience i have ever had with an airline our initial flight to dubai was canceled by royal air maroc and we had to find a new flight at the last minute i found that booking with them was extremely simple unfortunately we had to cancel our flight the day of the departure i called the customer service waited about  minutes before i could speak with someone and within  minutes the flight was canceled and they offered me a full refund the person on the line was extremely nice understanding and willing to help us i had never dealt with such a nice employee from any airline i got the full refund on my credit card the day after i usually chose the cheapest flight ticket regardless of the airline but from now on ill definitely make sure to check with british airways first
not verified  ba cancelled our original return flight and rebooked us a day later we had no issue with this just enjoyed an extra days holiday but others might not have been so flexible however they overlooked rebooking our connecting flight from lhr and we were fortunate that there was still space on the flight when we checked in at atl the aircraft was newish and in excellent condition flight was around  capacity service was excellent staff were friendly and efficient dinner was good breakfast was disappointing with little choice the lhr to bhd leg was equally good and i am beginning to think that ba are getting their mojo back again
 trip verified  boarding was slow and uncomfortable on account of the lack aircon at the gate the club suite cabins were about  full but the rest of the plane cant have been much more than  occupancy whether this is the reason why cabin crew on the flight were cut to the bare minimum is hard to say but they certainly had to work hard covering multiple cabins despite that the drink and food service in business was efficient and the current policy of serving all courses at once meant that dinner was done and dusted two hours after takeoff which is a real bonus on a nighttime flight however the quality of the food remains mediocre at best and the pasta dish was almost inedible the club suite is a big improvement on the ancient cw product although storage is a funny arrangement of tiny compartments that invite losing a smartphone or two one definitely misses the drawer at foot level in old cw the large screen really improves the viewing experience and the whole ife system was much more responsive the new seats dont significantly aid sleeping particularly as theres an obvious ridge at the level of the base of the spine waking up two hours before touchdown is definitely to be recommended in order to get breakfast over and to avoid the usual queues for the toilets performance of the flight deck was up to its usual high standard and arrival was twenty minutes ahead of schedule progress through border control was speedy but baggage collection was delayed for unspecified reasons overall a good flight
 trip verified   unfortunately having just flown in the new club world cabin this time we had an incredibly old plane the good was the cabin crew who tried to make the trip as pleasant as possible the bad was the inflight entertainment the screens were unwatchable when they worked my wifes didnt and post ipad era just dont live up the food was just about okay without being anything special but all served at once apparently the crew explained this is because of a shortage of staff im afraid ba has a lot to do to regain its standing in the aviation world the competition is too fierce now to sit on your laurels
"not verified   utterly appalling company weve flown with them two times now and both times its been a disaster the first time return flight was delayed by over  hours there was nobody at the gate to tell us this so a large group of passengers had to roam round dubai airport looking for ba staff there were none eventually another airline told us to go down some unmarked stairs where a very angry person told us it was our fault and we should have been given a letter we had no letter they then put us on a bus to the other terminal when we arrived there was nobody to greet us we were literally just left there we had to yet again contact another airline who managed to find us transport to the hotel when we got there we were told it was full and we couldnt choose our rooms we were given a terrible dirty cramped room several times throughout the night we were called to tell us our flight had been moved eventually we got to board the next day my tray table was broken as was the window blind and i didnt get a meal no compensation was offered the second time i need to reschedule my flight the website assured me this was fine but provided no link i needed to phone up if you need to phone ba dont even bother trying i never got to speak to anyone and just ended up booking a hotel to wait for my flight rather than rescheduling the food has been terrible meagre portions given infrequently my sandwich was inedible 
"
not verified  over the past  years i have flown with british airways twice and ended up in the exact same predicament of having to wait around all day in london heathrow for a  hour flight home to newcastle while the holidays and the plane staff are fantastic the customer service and the staff at heathrow are useless first time in february  i got stuck in heathrow due to storm ciara when travelling home from work which was not the airlines fault however the handling of the situation by the staff at the airport was a joke they had  to  staff ran a kiosk queue of over  unhappy travellers whilst they could have set up mini kiosks on the unused gates to get through everyone quicker their was no crowd control and at one point after queuing for  hours plus the staff decided to shut up shop in the end after a  hour battle i was lucky enough to get home on the last flight of the day through sheer luck when i finally spoke to someone in november  i decided to give ba a second chance and booked to go to new york since the plane landed late into lhr i missed my connecting flight which could have been avoided if the staff at heathrow had assisted me or held the plane for a short while as i rushed through customs i did manage to make it to the gate with  minutes to spare and the plane still in the terminal but since they had taken my luggage off the flight they told me to go to the service desk and refused to let me on since they had moved me on to a later flight my layover was now  hours and all i got from the guest services was a  food voucher to spend and a phone number for what i thought was complaints but after being on hold for  minutes found out it was not from complaints considering the fact this could have all been avoidable with more assistance to have only been given a food voucher for  seemed really cheap a few days after i got home i then raised a complaint expressing how annoyed i was and waited over a month for a response before chasing it up only to find the complaints staff were not working when i got a response i said i wanted  back off my holiday i got an apology and told the staff at heathrow will be better but in terms of good will and compensation i was offered nothing 
 trip verified   return trip cape town to durban in club class highlighted the inconsistency our outbound trip in december was good in all respects whereas the return trip was disappointing check in was fine apart from the agent failing to label one of bags priority resulting in a long wait for our third bag the lounge was busy but no complaints we went to the boarding gate at the check in time indicated on the screen where there was no sign of activity although the screen was still showing the same gate and departure time shortly thereafter two ground staff appeared and when approached said the flight was delayed from  to  and the gate was changed to the lower level bus gates the informational screens had now updated to the delayed time and new gate i checked on the flight radar app which showed that our aircraft had started in durban and flown to cape town port elizabeth back to cape town and it had been clear for some time that it had no hope of being on time for our flight in fact looking at its schedule and turn around times it was always going to be late boarding eventually started at  with departure at   minutes late drinks service only started  minutes later followed by lunch the food was good but the wine offering very mediocre and not up to club standards with the price of good wines in south africa there is no excuse for serving poor wine lunch service was quick but then the crew disappeared behind the curtain and there was no offering of top up drinks unless specifically requested overall this was a disappointing flight with a lacklustre crew
 trip verified   i used british airways for the first time and i have to admit that i am impressed with their service firstly i want to thank the lady that assisted me to weigh my luggage my flight was  however due to unforeseen circumstances i arrived at the airport around  i was convinced that i was going to miss my flight because the queue was very long i stood there a few minutes but then realized that i would miss my flight i went to club checkin and the lady was incredibly kind to me i just cannot believe how patience she was with me even though i was at fault she weighed my luggage and i was able to board the flight successfully i was not aware that this airline gives out free meals we got a sandwich and drink and we had an option to choose between vegetarian and chicken i personally love free stuff so i will be ditching flysafair even though they have excellent service as well in the near future unfortunately diversity the first time i flew was in  and i have to admit that i have never seen such diversity amongst cabin crew staff however with british airways it was different  the staff was very kind and friendly as well what a wonderful experience to fly with these guys
 trip verified   i recently had the unfortunate privilege of travelling on british airways from detroit to bangalore and back given that it is a long and arduous journey with multiple layovers i decided to spend extra and get a business class ticket i was quickly dissuaded of any misconception that i was special because i spent that extra money or was in business class from shoddy service to rudeness and insolence from ground staff i experienced nothing but frustration and insecurity throughout my journeys the trump was being stranded in london having missed my connection and spending close to  hours to get to the front of the counter to rebook my flight being a business class traveller had no bearing as we were all told to stand in one gigantic line and wait our turn some special passengers were escorted to the club world check in when we asked the lady she told us to continue standing where we were and she would come back to get us when the counter freed up needless to say it never did finally got my turn with no extra help from any of the ground staff that was running around in a frenzy and was rebooked so i come back to the question can big corporations lie with no accountability why would i spend my hardearned money on something that gave me nothing extra shame on you british airways for your complete disregard for your passengers stop your lying or update your promises
 trip verified   i have flown with ba for many years and today was another poor experience as ive witnessed the airline decline into a subpar service i understand that its been a tough two years for airlines but bas decline started before the pandemic and it has now truly plummeted enormous queues at jfk ba checkin terminal  even the priority lane was at a standstill for at least half an hour before people started complaining theyd miss their flights terrible efficiency at the checkin counters at times only one member of staff is processing people whilst other ba staff stood around on their phones or having a chat one member of staff stopped processing a man desperately trying to catch his flight in order to start processing someone else who had jumped in the interior of the plane was generally filthy crumbs bits of food stains marks all around the seating area they give you a single wet wipe which i used to think was for your hands but now i see most passengers wiping down their surrounding area there are some very good and courteous members of staff but there are also some awful members of staff who behave unprofessionally on this particular flight one of the cabin crew is as swearing about his colleague at the back of the plane who apparently wasnt pulling his weight very poor i used to be a proud ba flyer but now i just feel like im clinging on to my airline status which doesnt actually provide you a better service these days
 trip verified   the entertainment selection was sub par minimal selections and the new releases were  not new releases my food left something to be desired two of the seats in our row the earphone jack didnt work the plane was either uncomfortably hot or too cold find a medium temp just overall a very basic generic airline
 trip verified   straightforward and friendly baggage drop on to south lounge no polite conversation on have you used our lounge before no indication that it was so busy there was nowhere to sit at all considering even the m distancing had to roam the entire lounge lugging our bags on the carpeted floor with no success at all gave up after  minutes and decided to try another lounge arrived and everything was actually right in front of us and actually found somewhere to sit after  minutes of looking around menu was basic with no eggs hash browns or any breakfast cakes or muffins ordered a frittata as was so hungry made my way to the selfserve coffee counter which had basic coffee and was straight away put off by flies hovering over the croissants and fruit flight was departing from a gate where you had to take a train to and as if to rub salt in the wound were then told that dxb flight usually leaves from there and shouldve gone to the lounge near there looking at the individual cubicles which was to be honest our top reason for choosing business class gave me heart however the doors cannot close till take off i asked for the artisan crisps or biscuits on the menu and it took them over an hour lunch came in another almost hour asked if could swap puddings as am not a crumble person said will surely try but clearly didnt with no apologies or even trying portions were small plus saw quite a few fellow passengers sleeping through lunch so asked if could have more but all was finished chocolates are lindor nothing special about the other amenities toilets were no different to what youd expect amenity kit was basic duvet seemed well used it was not worth almost  times the amount of a regular ticket naive to trust claims of world class standards
not verified  on arrival at the warsaw airport the check in zone was the only one that was not announced on the flight board  we had to guess and ask random people where to go once we finally found the checkin desks luggage drop and checkin was appalling it took us over  hours to get our bags checked and we were half way through the queue the whole process was disorganised and very slow really the last thing you want when looking after  small impatient kids lady in warsaw airport who was supposed to direct passengers to the correct queue was useless one checkin desk for euro traveller  club europe one for bag drop and one for the checkin  flight left delayed but the pilots managed to catch up and landed with a small delay crew on the plane was nice and attentive luckily the in air experience was much better but sort out your ground service at warsaw airport
 trip verified   in glasgow one check in desk open huge queue with no business check in it took me close to an hour to bagdrop getting onto the aircraft in glasgow no hello from the crew and the same getting off  i normally find ba cabin crew very nice breakfast was a very tired looking croissant  i used the ba lounge in terminal  not very keen on the new table service poor choice and miniscule portions lounge staff were very nice in both directions on arrival at lhr there was a coach transfer from t to t we were packed in like sardines so much for social distancing the flight from lhr to pisa was delayed and once we boarded we sat on the aircraft for another hrs  mins captain advised us that there was no tow truck for push back and when it did eventually arrive there were no baggage handlers to load the containers no drinks or anything offered while we waited food was not even worth mentioning as far as club europe goes its not worth the extra cost no priority baggage as mine were last onto the belt in pisa seats are economy seats with the centre one blocked off the first officer summed it up when we arrived in pisa sorry folks this trip was a pretty poor show by ba and he was right for the return trip on hogmanay we left on time ive never been on a flight to or from pisa which has left in time pisa lounge is nice enough but the food choice is laughable on board i gave the food a miss  heathrow back to glasgow flight left on time food was an antipasto of some sort which i declined  both cases were last off again club europe is really not worth the money as you are in an economy cabin i would have thought that ba would do more about their food and onboard service since the cabin is what it is
 trip verified  after two years of being unable to fly to our second home in south africa because of covid it was fantastic to be back on board a ba flight to cpt and in the club suite seats k and k to boot these seats are a huge improvement on the old yinyang cw seats in terms of privacy ease of access and the ife screen but the cabin still felt densely occupied and the seats were just as uncomfortable when lying flat storage was a mixed blessing too with three rather fussy little compartments rather than the decent sized drawer in the old cw meaning that a laptop would have to be stored above the food onboard was woeful although serving all three courses at the same time does at least mean that the dinner service isnt dragged out cabin crew went about their business dutifully but with little enthusiasm and there were the usual queues for the toilets the flight itself was uneventful and landing was more or less on time cpt had an efficient arrangement for checking forms immediately after leaving the airbridge and there were no queues at immigration it was good to be back
 trip verified   i paid  for a round trip flight to london and back in premium economy they bumped me from the seat for the flight back and told me id be issued a refund instead of being issued a refund i had to contact them through several different methods phone website twitter and finally email they told me id be getting  back which is less than half of the  i paid for the upgrade instead they refunded  i emailed again and they told me id be getting  more back when i emailed again saying that that doesnt add up to the original amount i was told i was getting they simply replied with thats the final amount turns out that meant they were taking back the initial refund of  and i was only getting  total so i emailed them again asking why they changed the amount and theyve yet to respond so i called this morning and after explaining politely what i was calling for they hung up on me
 trip verified  very nice return flight with ba to add to my previous review i really like how ba organises boarding and disembarking processes in groups this is super comfortable as  passengers dont jump out and then sweat in a queue when the gate is not even there the a was new and the cabin had a fresh feeling with nice mood lighting row  has an enhanced legroom and thus makes the hour hop very comfortable once again amazing staff and they were even more attentive and accommodating to gold level passengers always coming and asking if any help is needed lovely humus beetroot and quinoa salad for food great wifi at really competitive pricing  i think it is great that they also have food  alcohol offered to buy online for all travel classes domestic t arrivals is a breeze
 trip verified   overall a very lovely flight with ba to edinburgh during christmas holidays lounge was ok quite worn out although staff and food were nice much better than when i travelled last time although the plane seemed old the cabin felt very fresh clean temperature perfectly adjusted to my liking around c and had a funky lighting although seats are the same as those in economy they are pretty comfortable for a hour hop much better than those at air france and together with an enhanced legroom in row  it was wonderful for gold card passengers ba automatically reserves row  in club europe with enhanced legroom which i think is a great touch the crew especially the purser were phenomenal extremely friendly adaptive to your needs and professional leaving a very pleasant flight aftertaste afternoon tea catering was lovely for this short flight sandwiches and scones were tasty i am actually a fan of wellpresented however simpler meals on board to my opinion they are just tastier and give a feeling of trust for a quick hop ba ticked all the marks here in comparison on a cdglhr leg air france presented a chic cold starter however to me it looked a bit too complicated and except from the duck terrine rather unappetising  klm served a super nice and simple chicken caesar but it was in a paper box one big drawback was the first wing experience at t the queue there was so long that i decided to go through the regular lines instead its quite disappointing given how much money regular flyers  their companies spend to earn a gold status nevertheless the flight and most importantly the crew completely negated that drawback the flight was  one way  return incl transfer to kirkwall which was pretty expensive however the service seemed like it was worth the money
not verified   first of this was one of the smoothest uk to us flights i have taken the boarding was appalling and had families with kids queue for no reason at all they called families to the front but then decided to board business and premier classes first which i appreciate why but why call families the worse seats ever and the legroom was appalling the entertainment system is basic it does not support bluetooth headphones the usb does not support your own devices for movies although the website says yes and the headphones input was as good as useless  the crew were nice so sorry i missed that
 trip verified   flying during covid is always a challenge bas verifly app worked perfectly and online checkin was seamless the bags drop at t was seamless and boarding was done efficiently by zones although an older  it had been refurbished and everything was new and clean the cabin crew were a credit to the airline  smartly dressed friendly and keen to please we were offered two drinks before lunch was served with more drinks with the meal the food was acceptable and we were given a tasty sandwich before landing obviously it was only economy but after  hours flying i arrived relaxed and unstressed
 trip verified   flew to nashville via chicago in first excellent check in and security lounge was good food and drink choices very good first cabin on  is  seats comfortable seat entertainment a little clunky cabin service top banana food and drinks choices and tastes amazing for an aircraft a special call out to stewart tim a credit to ba
 trip verified   i had low expectations of business class ba on european routes but this flight was even worse t is a mess with  minute queue to check bags with tons of people arriving late check in guy seemed clueless about turkey needs for pcr etc ba lounge is a joke so i went out and got sushi from a restaurant  there was mulled wine in crowded lounge but just bad all round boarding was chaos and we left an hour late a was jammed full but business class there is little legroom and just the middle seat free you might as well fly a low cost carrier for same seat there is no inflight screen no overhead screen although the curtain was closed economy people used the forward bathroom with no crew sending them back the only salvation was a pretty decent shepherds pie and red wine otherwise i would avoid flying ba the next day i flew the same aircraft type to bahrain on another carrier with proper business class seat in flight screen headphones good food and drinks arabic coffee dates and gracious service ba hang your head in shame
 trip verified   weve just used the new club world for the first time and were delighted with the new configuration the privacy afforded is so much better inflight entertainment and storage were brilliant unfortunately we had the most lethargic crew ever who once the meal was served basically disappeared the wines were warm they even forgot to offer my wife a drink with lunch and she also had a pair of used socks in her storage cabinet heathrow was a nightmare as often happens being  minutes early was rewarded with a minute wait for a gate then a  hour wait for our luggage absolutely shocking in covid times
 trip verified   my flight yesterday  was due to take off at  soon after reaching the gate first passengers were called for preboarding then gate staff said the aircraft has not been given permission to land at aberdeen due to poor weather airport information kept telling passengers to go to gate for a further hour and a half before passengers learned the flight had been cancelled via the ba app we then had to join a line for the customer service desk it took two hours to reach the desk in my case on reaching the desk i was told i had automatically been booked on the following mornings flight and being offered overnight hotel that did not meet my needs so i requested cancellation and to get my bags back i was told to cancel my booking on the ba app they could not do it at the desk i was then directed via a gate to collect my bags this meant having to go via the uk border to reach a baggage belt then i waited for my bags for  hours because they had automatically stored my bags for the following days flight ba staff were rude and dismissive of customer complaints at length of time bags were taking to arrive like it was our fault for cancelling the alternative flight they had offered the next day
 trip verified   it is first time we have flown ba business class in a  aircraft and hopefully it will be the last firstly the checkin and crew were great  friendly and helpful it was manual checkin not a machine which is always much nicer no complaints at all in that department food on the journey was adequate but no choice of starter or desert and  choices for main course business class seating is  with alternate seats facing backwards as are both the centre seats we were in those so you are either facing a stranger on the aisle seat or you put the screen up  and you are in a claustrophobic bubble you cannot see out you cannot see other passengers it was slightly better as it was my wife and myself but it would be utterly awful to be shut in this space with a stranger  nowhere to put a glass bottle of water book or glasses within easy reach unless you keep the table down in most business class seats you can tuck your bag under the seat in front for take off and landing but there is nowhere to put a bag so everything has to go in the overhead locker and they are missing over the first  rows of centre seats so not much storage space we were in row  and to get out you have to climb over the legs and leg rest of the person in the aisle seat in row  now if you are travelling solo in the centre seats that is always the case but normally if as a couple you take aisle and centre at least you are climbing over your partners legs not some stranger i am ft  and could just about manage my wife at ft  could not get over without disturbing the passenger in the row behind the reading light was hopeless and did not shine on your book and the light controlled from the handset did not work at all this is utterly awful design and will certainly make us avoid ba in future if at all possible
 trip verified   i claimed my miles right after my trip at the beginning of august they took almost  months to reply and to my surprise to reject my request without providing any reasons i have sent them a complaint per email and i still didnt get a reply it has been  months and i am still waiting for an answer furthermore many people were not wearing masks and when i asked the flight attendants why they were allowing people not to wear the masks they said there are medical exceptions when we ordered more drinks they replied that we needed to pick them out ourselves what a business class customer service
 trip verified  british airways is taking reservations and then cancelling flights without giving any reasons we had further plans that all needed to be cancelled because of the flights ba did nothing to ease the process and offered absolutely no explanation of why the flight was cancelled i am not going to travel on ba again and may not travel again this year at all
 trip verified   i have a flight booked for january  they send me an email at the beginning of december informing me that my flight was changed my second flight was moved to the next day making my layover  hours called them was told to just cancel what kind of answer is that i mean i still need to fly to where i am going and booking with another airline closer to the day i am flying will be more expensive it is a very big inconvenience for me and i dont even get an apology just cancel
 trip verified   i had a future travel voucher for singapore to london which i thought would be perfect for my flight to relocate home id been under the impression that it was a simple process  just call up and book onto the same route that id previously paid for and that had previously been cancelled by ba themselves  but on a new date how wrong i was first i had to pay to top up my flight  a significant amount equivalent to around the value of my original flight which was a redemption ticket of part cash part airmiles this was because of price increases and the fact that i was flying at peak times the extra charge also meant that i overall paid more than face value their online price at the time for the ticket for the flight as well as them still keeping the airlines id redeemed they explained that the online price and redemption prices differ and thats just how the system works however if i had taken a refund i would have lost a lot of money to administration fees they had me in a desperate situation where i was losing hundreds of pounds to them no matter what i did so i cut my losses and booked the flight or at least i thought i did the call centre agent  who had previously explained she was working remotely with no manager or supervision and no way to escalate issues  took my card details including full card number dates and cvc code  and explained my flight ticket and receipt for payment for an extra bag would follow a week later i still had no ticket no details no charge to my card no booking reference  nothing i called up to confirm the call centre agent i reached apologised and advised he would escalate it to the bookings team and again took my card details once again i waited another week and sign of being booked onto a flight thus began a cycle of increasingly frequent and desperate calls to british airways as they repeatedly failed to do the simple task of booking me on a flight spanning over  weeks  on the friday before my monday flight i sat in tears to another ba call centre agent who promised to get me on my flight and book my extra bag the next day  around  hours before i was due to fly i finally got my booking reference yet they still failed to charge me for or add on my extra bag luckily i noticed this on my check in details and managed to add a bag online the whole experience was stressful costly and resulted in me spending hours and days on the phone listening to british airways hold music furthermore there has been a significant cutback to bas inflight catering service due to covid resulting in smaller portions leaving me quite hungry on such a long flight though ive flown ba repeatedly with few problems in the past their service has gone significantly downhill
 trip verified   extremely disappointed in trip experience i am gold mvp  miler with alaska airlines my ticket and travel wasnt linked with alaska airlines when speaking with alaska representative they confirmed it was due to lack of effort on british airways in accomplishing this task i could over look the lack of effort on this even though frustrating the main issue is the ticketing and flt connection process  i departed egypt this morning with connecting tickets in hand once i arrived in usa apparently my alaska as  flt was changed to a  hour later flight with a completely different airline delta who does that without notifying the customer i found this out when trying to go through security in seattle they said my ticket was not valid i had to go to alaska airline to find out what the issue was they explained british airways had rebooked with delta this took about mins with customer service then i had to go to delta to sort the mess out i am so frustrated
 trip verified   british airways seems happy to encourage the spread of covid took the am flight from t at heathrow to paris cdg on nd november which was boarded by bus from a remote gate the bus driver insisted on packing the bus to its maximum possible load standing by the door and telling customers to squeeze right up and he was not leaving the terminal until the bus was full the result was that passengers in the bus were packed tight and the maximum facial distancing was about cms a second coach to the aircraft followed just a few minutes later and had about  customers on it it is shameful that ba ground staff exercise no control and did nothing to check the bus boarding process and whilst the flight was okay this serves to underline how ba seem happy to disregard any covid safety protocols in the airport environment in contrast on recent air france and iberia flights their ground staff are much more disciplined and actually try to control customers maybe this underlines the very laissez faire attitude to covid that now prevails in the uk 
 trip verified   i was refused an early check in and was told to come back at pm for a pm departure there was no staff until  and both staff members were very inexperienced with poor attitude taking up a lot of time for each passenger
 trip verified  check in was ok all documents were scanned without problems the flight was delayed by  minutes due to crew members been stuck on the m not the airlines fault  replacement crew where found and boarding onto a new a neo went ahead the club europe cabin was  rows of economy seats with the middle seat blocked off for me at  tall i can fit ok however anyone taller than me might struggle with limited leg room the inflight service was a a stop  start affair nothing to write home about the crew failed to work as a team you had to go to the galley to get extra drinks i was even served cool coffee with filter paper in the bottom of the cup landing and disembarking went without a hitch and included a bus ride to the terminal not bas finest hour
 trip verified  arrived at the south airport in tenerife  hours before departure iberia had not opened the check in even with a full flight waiting the usual check in process post covid took place with the usual errors in the paperwork slowing things down passing security was fine and iberia had a lounge with  person capacity to serve drinks and a simple selection of cold food boarding was done by a  meter long bus ride as the plane was parked at the gate not sure why the plane was a very new a neo with  rows of club seating the seat was ok for a  hour flight but anything longer and i would expect club europe to have more leg room than the couple of inchs between my knee and the seat in front food and drink where very good served with steel cutlery and glass tumblers good selection of wine to go with a above average salad overall it was an ok experience with a great cabin crew
not verified   checkin very slow no app checkin and could not check my vaccine qr code online check in staff friendly but too few of them ba silver card holder and no stockholm lounge  to use boarding fine but plane was worn out seats close together and row  even worse  crew really professional and happy it seemed arrival at heathrow a total shambles ba landed at  no gate so waited and waited for  minutes then ba jetty didnt work then ba had no steps very slow to leave plane as only moderately mobile wheelchair passengers struggle down the steps everyone was very patient and supportive but it was terrible to watch so ba skimping on lounge plane condition and gate crew good seats very uncomfortable
 trip verified   after h queuing at the checkin desk i am told that my booked seat is not available why do you sell seats that you do not have
not verified   outbound seated in row  i was told they had run out of my chosen food option shepherds pie so i had to settle for gnocchi the steward had the temerity to blame the food supplier  as if ba could not get a better one on the return boarding from the back not by priority then seated in row  i had the last half glass of champagne only because one of the other passengers in row  had declined food was rigatoni with vegetables overall penny pinching by ba in club class dreadful  not for us again
 trip verified   flew club europe london  tenerife south  november and returned  november club europe seats are not comfortable  you pay a lot more for exactly the same leg room but have the middle seat of  empty to spread out a tiny bit for the fare i would hope for at least a couple more inches of leg room  it would make a huge difference we did at least get a meal outbound cottage pie and inbound sausage and mash which were not too bad and a drinks service however on the inbound ba had no white wine  apparently there is a problem with their suppliers did not prebook seats due to the extortionate fees for pre booking just about any other airline will not charge for pre booking a seat if you are in premium classes back to the flights both in a new or nearly near a both very smooth with no timing issues at all so all good in that respect not a good check in experience at tenerife south  just tacked onto the end of a large tui check in queue also not a great lounge  the vip lounge is merely adequate with ok seating for an hour or two i would only just about recommend  there are still reservations about exactly what ba is trying to become
 trip verified   hours standing in line for boarding pass airline would not allow me to obtain boarding pass electronically then they said the flight was overbooked so my adult daughter got bumped from the flight and yes we used verifly my flight is now delayed for at least  minutes they are so unorganized and slow getting a seat in advanced is not performed like other airlines you have to wait even though i paid for it avoid this airline at all costs absolute worst
 trip verified  i have been trying to get a hold of ba to change my return flight for the past week now i cant change online because im flying out of another city so the service is unavailable online ive tried live chat several times and waited  hours only to be told theres no one available during business hours i have tried calling and the line always drops from their end customer service is non existent however of course if you call the new booking line someone immediately picks up of course however they cant help me nor put me through to anyone apparently shambolic excuse of an airline that doesnt deserve to be a national airline i havent had these problems at all and ive been flying throughout covid for work unfortunately its been easier to change my flights with domestic latin american airlines and i dont even speak spanish 
 trip verified   this whole experience was sickening over  grand spent on the holiday and their customer service is a shambles drop down menu to drop down menu not stating what i wanted to complain about would not even allow me to add tier points the flight to london was marred with problems in london we received an upgrade email to fast track and vip lounges due to amount spent this never happened and treated as paupers wherever we showed the email we had to change planes to the other side of the airfield the resort riu paradise beach was riddled with bad food drugs and bad attitude and when you complained you were fobbed off as they knew there was no ba staff to sound off too the return journey was a shambles and more delays finally arriving back at manchester completely exhausted and needing another holiday there is light at the end of this horrid tunnel virgin atlantic have just started the same route from this month now we all know this is a better option
not verified   poorly mismanaged services this time disappointed with the huge queues due to unavailability of attendants at the counters had to wait around  hours just to check in then came the boarding again had to wait at the passage for  mins finally when we thought things are better now on reaching london our next boarding pass was not scanned around  passengers including me had to wait from  am until  am for the next flight on boarding the next flight no space to keep the luggage journey was really hectic and did not expect this from ba
not verified   currently dreading my flight with ba considering they have hung up on me and mum on the customer service line twice now and will not reply via the so called live chat all we wanted to find out was how there were two flights booked under my mums name plus a flight for my dad and not one for me we just wanted to be able to make a name change absolutely impossible their website is unusable their customer service is a shambles they couldnt change the name told me that we shouldve done the booking more carefully well youre going to have these people making mistakes so maybe change your website so that we can make changes to our flights like hello its the st century you should have a button saying change name anyways not the point the woman on the phone started raising her voice at us because she wasnt making it clear on what to do then when i gave up towards the end of the call i just said thanks for your help ill deal with it la got cut off  minutes and got nothing all i can say is good luck
 trip verified  another ba shuttle flight and a good one fantastic flying weather and i would say a  load factor good professional crew friendly and complimentary snack arrived early so now worries and getting to the a gates at t makes for an easy exit still a cut above their competitors although a bit more expensive they make up for that in total product delivery
 trip verified  flight from larnaca to lhr check in was ok the lounge was an aspire lounge and shared it was basic but ok flight left  minutes late but made up time en route there were  rows to the business class cabin on this a service was ok but it was quite expensive for the product offered its a long sector and the food wasnt great drinks were ok but the staff kept going on about a lack of glassware not really interested if im being honest when weve paid a lot of money for it staff were friendly and as responsive as they could be club europe is fine for flights less than three hours but not for longer the seats are not so comfortable not dreadful but something for ba to think about
 trip verified   upon checking in at the club desk in lisbon airport our passenger locator forms were found to have an incorrect reference number for our day  test and the check in agent denied us boarding causing my wife who had recently spent some long time in hospital in the uk much distress he was only doing his job of course but we requested him to call a supervisor the check in manager goncalo ribeiro came to our rescue  not only did he identify the problem but spent half an hour of his time arranging a new supplier for our day  test uploading it onto our plfs verifying our flight documentation and fast tracking us through checkin he was at the gate on boarding to wish us a comfortable journey we could not have asked for better service he was a very professional ambassador for ba
 trip verified  club europe on british airways outstanding and wonderful to have ba back the welcome on board was warm and sincere flight attendants helpful friendly and professional great updates from the flight deck super lunch and good choice of wines ba at its best hopefully this excellence is also a reflection of a new ceo with the departure of alex cruz
not verified   good flight but boarding was chaos was gifted with the beautiful a gate at lhr t so we were bussed to the plane first time ive used a bus gate there the a was at t at a gate with a jetway nevertheless  passengers full flight boarded via steps  this caused an hour waiting at the gate as well as the baggage taking ages also the seat recline on ggatl f is broken
 trip verified   usual ba economy trip pleasant crew complimentary snack and water and small bar service which has reasonable prices i am not a fan of the new neo aircraft very cramped seating and uncomfortable the armrests between seats are tiny thin and short in length and offer little support for two people and not enough for one aisle width seems smaller and going to the toilets at the back seems awkward i have done a transatlantic on this aircraft with another airline and its not for me other than that ba still offers a good product that can be good value or over priced this time it was good value
 trip verified   check in was easy security quick lounge fine lounge service returning to pre pandemic days and some self service allowed which was great flight was fine my wife and son felt breakfast was more like old style economy food and perhaps i agree there was nothing bad about food but nothing great either drinks were fine and proactively served on arrival efficient pcr testing where it was needed and fast turnaround baggage off quick
not verified   what has happened to british airways the whole preflight experience now is prehistoric they appear to have gone back to the s and now make passengers physically queue to manually check in adding hours to the journey not to mention how ridiculous it is to bunch people together in a big slow queue on the premise its due to covid precautions they are the only airline making passengers do this and they cant even open all the desks so for  passengers they had two check in staff like the post office in  apart from the aircraft and cabin crew literally everything else about this airline has disintegrated to the point where theyre just not reliable enough to use for business purposes and their attitude towards exec club members and other loyal customers is a disgrace ive chosen and insisted upon ba for business and personal travel for decades and accumulated a lot of air miles i also have not one but two ba amex companion vouchers that cost me k of spending to earn so that tells you how much ive supported this airline despite their shocking decline in recent years in the last year ive booked  ba flights  personal and  business flights for me and two colleagues but after taking my money and wasting my time planning the itineraries  of the  have been cancelled forcing me to tear up my plans and pay double for last minute alternatives with other airlines the personal one to st lucia they cancelled my return  days after flying me out forcing me to cancel my holiday and fly back immediately or risk being stuck there for  weeks that cost me my  holiday and they offered nothing by way of compensation a couple of weeks ago i noticed that one of my amex companion vouchers was apparently going to expire on nov th this year so i tried to speak to them as the world has largely been closed since march  i assumed it would be straightforward to extend the voucher to a time there are holiday destinations properly open not to mention my experiences dealing with routinely cancelled flights and my reluctance to risk a third person on another holiday but after  days going around in circles speaking really bad english to people who have no empathy for me or even live in the same country i finally got through to someone at ba who told me that no they wont extend the voucher im even a shareholder but after this level of treatment and disrespect i will not spend another penny with this airline im not even going to bother using my second voucher and ive cancelled my ba amex i work in the music business managing tours for bands so i reckon i book  flights a year and my only satisfaction is knowing their attitude has cost them that roll on the inevitable ba administration but at least somebody else can buy it for cheap and start rebuilding what was once the worlds favourite airline but now the most ridiculed whod have thought ba could ever make ryanair look like an attractive option
 trip verified   i have just returned from an amazing holiday and felt compelled to write a review the flight is generally a torment for me being a nervous flyer however on this occasion it was an absolute delight on both inward and outward journeys i was impressed by the professionalism friendliness and kindness of the cabin crew i was in economy but was treated with the respect and service i would expect in the first class cabin my particular thanks must go to amir who was absolute joy and a credit to british airways i cannot wait to fly again with you and that from me is huge thank you so so much
 trip verified   the plane was clean and air quality very good timing was perfect i was seated in  k to begin with  i had difficulty using the buttons to get the leg rest up as well as push back the seat when i requested a cup of tea just as the drink service started i was told that tea would be served after dinner i did press the loght twice to indicate my need and nothing happened at dinner there was no tea service i did get up and go to the galley and ask for a cup of tea  there was no hand soap in the washroom however on my way to london from toronto my experience was a good one however it was not the same on my return flight
 trip verified   the service was excellent the cabin staff were attentive and efficient the food and drinks were very good the seat in the new suites is extremely comfortable and the additional privacy is really nice overall a very enjoyable flight
not verified   i booked and paid for what i thought was a business class seat on a flight to athens what i got was a premium economy seat the first nine rows were business class seats rows  to  were what should have been the premium economy cabin but had been added to the business class section which had less comfortable seats that didnt fully recline unlike the seats in rows  to  i was in row  this is not a case of me being snobby but simply a point of principle and a clear case of ba misselling had i known prior that i would be paying the same business class price but for seats that were less comfortable than other business class passengers on the same flight i wouldnt have booked i complained on board along with several other passengers who also resented being scammed in that way i also made a formal complaint to ba but was fobbed off apparently this is a long running scam i dont know how they get away with it
 trip verified   terrible customer service booked my flight before covid couldnt go still cant go as borders are still closed i wasnt given an option just told i have to take a voucher now i have no job and no plans to travel and they refuse to give me my money back although i booked for a flight for cayman and i still havent been able to go they cannot provide the service i paid for and refuse to refund me they are not sympathetic or understanding  the voucher is valid for another two years i wonder how many flights will go up by then i wonder how many more regulations there will be ive been such a good customer and feel i deserve better 
 trip verified  this was my first flight during the pandemic so it was understandable the difficulties facing airlines checkin was longer than normal due to the vaccine checks and passenger locator forms etc but on the return flight it was a total mess just two counters open for economy and one for business there were arguments regarding vaccine checks where two ba staff were contradicting each other it took an hour and ten minutes just to check in resulting in the flight delay on board i was not expecting great service  seating was extremely uncomfortable  inch pitch and  inch wide seats  just about bearable for an hour and a half flight  on board service was a packet of crisps and a small bottle of water from another no eye contact with me just handed out however i was pleased that disembarking passengers were let out in groups despite a few idiots who decided to stand a up to get their hand luggage out while the aircraft is was still taxing to the gate the cabin crew did manage to force them back to their seats and close the lockers
 trip verified  lca to lhr in club europe quick checkin at lca with speedy passport control and security aspire lounge was clean and spacious with reasonable buffet food and drink boarding by group and pushback on time ce stretched back a full  rows and the single toilet struggled drinks and meal service was efficient despite the many rows but the vegetarian option was the usual pasta splodge and reminiscent of economy of yore onboard wfi was adequate if rather slow and it shouldnt be charged for in business class arrival ahead of schedule disembarking en masse and through egates surprisingly quickly overall a flight that was typical of the postcovid standard for shorthaul business class
not verified   i had booked a flight from heathrow on friday th august  to fly to manchester airport on arrival at heathrow to check in the british airways staff informed me that i had booked both flight seats in my name by mistake i offered to pay a fee to get the second seat changed to my sisters name but british airways refused us to board and sent us home however the staff member who i spoke to at the desk promised to email us flight vouchers which i would get shortly so that i could fly at another time with ba since they do not offer refunds i never received these flight vouchers i have chased numerous times on the phone with ba staff who said that it was my error and that no flight vouchers would be sent to me they have no record that a staff member spoke to me and promised these vouchers they say i was just a no show which is inaccurate i have sent numerous emails to ba explaining what happened and asking form my promised vouchers i have had no response to my emailsmessages one ba staff member on the phone said that i should track down the lady i spoke to at heathrow and ask her if she remembers me so ludicrous as i did not take her name and i doubt she would remember me since she sees hundreds of ba customers a day 
 trip verified   we have flown with ba for many years and never will again where there is an alternative booked and paid for club class flights didnt receive a meal or drinks onboard crew were so unorganised we were delayed on the ground for  minutes prior to departing so they had plenty of time to prepare but the inflight service was delayed once up in the air they commenced the service albeit very slowly then abandoned it and closed the service altogether the crew never even had the decency to speak to us to apologise in person or even over the tannoy  complained to ba and received an apology by email with the usual we fell short of our standards generic speech but no offer of any partial refund or avios to compensate for the lack of service 
 trip verified   the crew at denver airport is top notch so impressed with their customer service they were very patient and courteous thank you all for being amazing
 trip verified   an ordinary ba domestic shuttle flight from belfast to london heathrow usually uneventful except for the cabin crew announcement three times advising people complete a uk passenger arrival form from the govuk website or risk prosecution some people challenged this statement and were rebuked ba cabin crew were adamant that this was now a requirement but the regular traveller amongst us knew this was incorrect advice some people were anxious departing the aircraft other than that crisp snacks and water were offered which is a nice touch sky cafe still not on sale  not quite sure why given covid protocols in the uk are mainly relaxed now ba is still by far the best operator from ulster to england
not verified   ive had to book six flights with ba recently all have either been cancelled or had a significant time change the latest flight was so late into heathrow we missed our connecting flight even though wed scheduled around  hours between flights ba staff at heathrow were rude and generally clueless for the most part they couldnt get us to our destination within  hours of our scheduled arrival time we booked an easyjet flight from gatwick instead and had to pay to get ourselves to gatwick a complaint was registered several weeks ago with no response so far perhaps ba have a backlog of complaints the way they are performing at the moment its an embarrassment that our national flag carrier is being comfortably out performed by budget airlines but that appears to be the case at the moment
 trip verified   the service is got super inconsistent on ba and the management of our diverted flight was unprofessional and lacked any shred of empathy the flight down from london i was in business class i asked for the mini bottle of champagne that i always treat myself to the cabin crew member said i cant give you the bottle only a glass however the other crew member was giving bottles to other passengers in row one and two we were in  i asked for a top up and staff said not until they were finished the business cabin in case they would run out the crew should not pick and choose one passenger over another and change the service that is not fair we got diverted as volcano ash was impacting tenerife we needed to refuel at gran canaria  mins from tenerife but we were diverted to malaga we got an e mail clearly stating meals and accommodation the crew also said the same  we got to the hotel and no dinner for us and there was no room service breakfast was at eight but our bus to the airport was also at eight all we could do at  was to grab something from the buffet and run to the coach i have been on diverted flights before we got dinner and  breakfast
 trip verified  such terrible service in club world such indifference and lackadaisical attitude hardly any service everything has to be asked for and gotten asked for a cup of tea and had the flight saywhaa and then when i said cup of tea she said yesasked if wanted milk and sugar brought to me lukewarm tea with  sugar sachets no spoon or stirrer pushed the bell for stirrer and had to wait a full  mins before someone came by eventually for a spoon and had to drink cold tea seriously bawhat are you doing is this how you welcome back people to fly
 trip verified   lhr to lca galleries lounge chockablock first thing on a wednesday morning and t seemed as bustling as prepandemic boarding by groups efficient and flight almost full superficially the cabin seemed clean although long hairs on pillows gave the game away expanded club europe stretching back  rows  the new norm departure on time good drinks service which sequed smoothly into lunch postcovid lunch remains restricted  doco must be horrified by what theyre having to produce miniscule salads and the worst gnocchi dish ive ever tasted wifi access wasnt free for business class passengers  for an hour of intermittent service is excessive arrival ahead of schedule and no issues with passport control at lca
 trip verified   very pleasant flight to lisbon it was a full flight and we left about min late as we were taken to the aircraft by bus at heathrow and the gate staff allow too much hand luggage to the aircraft however in the air great service by the  male crew on a big club class cabin friendly and efficient crew even to some demanding and obnoxious passengers late breakfastbrunch served was tasty what a contrast to the iberia crew lisbonmadridlondon who were cold and unprofessional
 trip verified  no check in staff for economy never experienced this before while business passengers strolled up economy passengers were left standing for  mins plus
 trip verified   no refund for flights cancelled  months ago but provided a ticket voucher valid until  april  tickets bought on edreams on june   for a flight on july   from geneva to so paulo through london british airways round trip the lhrgru flight was cancelled without any explanation i contacted both edreams and ba a number of times in the last  months but they did not refund the  euros that i paid
 trip verified   stranded in the lounge because i wasnt allocated a seat this for a flight that i booked months ago i didnt want to use them but was forced to because emirates wasnt available i advise travelers to shun them too and look for more customer friendly options
 trip verified   i think british airways needs to be much clearer about what their covid travel flexibility really means because it doesnt pass the commonsense test i purchased a roundtrip business class ticket from new york toandfrom mykonos through london i traveled there with no problem the day before my return to new york though i took my covid test and learned that i tested positive i tried to call the airline on the many usless numbers they provide on their website the recorded message drones on and on about how they have no one to answer the phone because of covid safety and simply says therefore we cant answer your call try again no ability to leave a callback number or a voicemail etc for whatever reason the ba website thought that i had bought the ticket through a thirdparty agent i did not  i bought it on bacom and so wouldnt let me cancel or reschedule the flight on the web site i called and called over the coming days and could not get through to the london athens or new york lines two days later after having  negative pcr tests the most accurate test i learned i was not positive and so had to buy a new  return flight to the us ive now been calling the ba usa customer service line for nearly a month at least every other day never to get through finally did and have been told that the fact that i couldnt get on the flight because of a covid scare counts for nothing the fact they dont have enough people answering the phone counts for nothing or that i was unable to change the flight to a few days later on the web site becuase the ticket was misbooked they have offered that if i send them a greek doctors note saying that i was sick then theyll give me a voucher for a future flight from mykonos to new york i am speechless at the stupidity of this whole situation 
 trip verified   my flight from boston to heathrow arrived in time but i and other passengers were not allowed to disembark the plane we were kept in the tarmac for one hour and a half without being given sufficient information about what was causing this delay because of this delay i and other passengers lost the connecting flight to tirana i was offered another connecting flight which was  hours later from the time of arrival when i booked this flight one of the main reasons that made me choose it was the fact that the layover was a little bit more than an hour turning it into an  hour layover i think is unacceptable and very poor customer service it shows lack of respect for your clients and lack of commitment by this company to provide to their customers what they were promised and what they paid for i am very disappointed by this experience
 trip verified  year after year the british airways ba service on the same route washingtonlondon is becoming worse we just had one bad experience after another on this route in july   british airways ba notified us that our connection flight to nice was bumped from pm to pm so we had to spend an extra  hours in the airport during this covid era their website and emails prior to our day of flight kept asking us to check ukgov for the covid rules and regulations for transit through london which said that no covid test was necessary if we could show proof of vaccine however upon our arrival at the airport they told us we needed to go to the basement to take a covid test to show negative results they charged us  per person for a rapid covid test which was an outrage and totally unnecessary we could have gotten the test done at a cheaper rate had we known that this was a requirement prior to our flight food service was horrible they served food with lots of cheese to me while i had requested a vegan meal due to may dairy allergies ba damaged our samsonite luggage and they told us at the airport that we needed to report this online we have been trying to resolve this issue since july and after asking us for photos like  times they are still giving us the run around 
 trip verified   ba used to be my go to carrier and i am a silver member however their service seems to have gone hugely downhill flights get cancelled the best alternative flights are offered and whilst in theory you can cancel or amend bookings online or on the app invariably this is not possible you cannot contact them by email and you may find yourself sitting on a phone for  plus minutes to speak to someone if they are busy due to cancelled flights they need to employ people to answer calls and emails promptly i was stunned by the recent cancellation to my catania flight two weeks before i was due to travel 
 trip verified   the entertainment system was working badly the screen was freezing every time i wanted to open flight map though the aircraft was  years only the window blinds worked with delays the crew informed passengers that there would be no headphones provided as it was supposed to be a shorthaul flight after flying with aeroflot and s airlines i expected to receive an excellent ba service but i got only a pack of crisps and a tiny bottle of water i think its unacceptable for a nonlowcost carrier to offer service like this i can get that hot meals on board are now rare i loved the most comfortable seats in my life i tend to have problems with sleeping on board but this time i didnt even noticed my falling asleep right after takeoff 
 trip verified   i flew on british airways cheapest fare which was a hand baggage only fare in economy class despite this being the cheapest fare you can actually carry two pieces of cabin luggage both weighing up to kg each the value for money here is incredible the ground staff at london heathrow are very polite and helpful the plane was clean and the cabin crew were very smiley and polite this was a short haul flight but we were given a free packet of crisps and a bottle of water there was wifi onboard which we paid  for the full flight access package and it was great it was fast enough to stream a movie on netflix if you are considering between a low cost carrier and a premium carrier like ba pay the extra and fly with the premium carrier with the generous cabin luggage allowance and the free snacks on board it may end up being cheaper and nobody claps when the plane lands
 trip verified   very efficient evening bag drop security quick galleries north lounge was very good food and drinks fine plane left on time pre ordered door was ok early arrival fortunately only our bags were not given priority tags and came out early
 trip verified   me and my  year  months baby girl flew business class from moscow domodedovo to london heathrow on  august when we landed at heathrow my baby was sleeping i asked stewards for my stroller and they said it is going to wait for me at the and of the corridor before entrance to terminal building i grabbed my sleeping baby who is nearly  kg and luggage bag another  kg and walked away i went and entered the building and met no one with my pram or just my pram left somewhere in this corridor and there was no one to ask just a flow of passengers behind me and in front of me on top of that we landed at terminal and i had to travel on a train to arrivals terminal for passport control and other procedures still on my own holding my baby and heavy bag on my shoulder i met no one whom i can ask for a help first british airways representative i met was after passport control  i explained the situation and he said that i have to go downstairs and my pram will be with my suitcases  no further assistance or help i had to wait another hour for luggage and pram i am absolutely frustrated upset and disappointed i can see that british airways do not care about mothers with kids at all
 trip verified   for this flight from heathrow t passengers were piled into the bus and left for  mins at the terminal  very unhappy passengers  and when confronted the ba transport managers response was sorry  we are still learning on arrival at the aircraft a gentleman who came on a wheelchair had no help with his luggage i helped shame  since lounge service was very good for the flight out from munich ba had not re signed up to the now open lounge in munich to me looks like a systemic failing rather than a one off event
 trip verified  ba encourage you to download verifly to speed up your checkin this is absolutely rubbish as the desk staff dont seem to want this they want to see the actual forms tests etc this wasted about  minutes and is pointless the return flight again had no access to the club lounge you pay for extras such as this as part of the business class ticket price and should by now be made available again last  flight not available at nce but this is more a part of the covid experience on board staff were good although one did joke to another welcome to ryanair on board food was very good for a short haul flight
 trip verified   they cancelled a flight i booked three months ago for some operational problem at a time where the prices are off the roof british airways could not give me any alternatives other than refund or a voucher 
 trip verified   ive been flying with ba for years and never had any issues i recently had to arrange to have surgery in budapest and naturally wanted to fly ba so i booked my flights from bhd to bud via lhr online on their site once booked i informed the hospital and confirmed my appointment the very next day i received an email from ba telling me they had cancelled my flight to bud but not to worry as they had moved me to an earlier a much earlier flight the same day only problem was this earlier flight departed around two hours before my flight from bhd arrived i would have thought that this would have flashed up on their system as being an issue but seemingly not interlude to get into hungary during covid one needs a valid reason with medical treatment being one i had to fill in a very confusing form on the hungarian police website that was a confusing mix of hungarian and pidgin english anyway form filled in with flight numbers etc emailed to the authorities there and exemption granted so i took the earlier flight but this meant i had to fly into london the previous evening and stay overnight in a hotel so operation booked hotel booked airport transfers booked immigration papers amended and re sent and admiration granted and flights re booked what could go wrong around three weeks before i was due to travel ba rather unsportingly decided to cancel my flight to bud again needless to say i was furious i complained to ba customer services and was given a stock excuse about covid disrupting air travel great excuse only having looked at bud arrivals info ryanair had been flying there once daily for at least the preceding several months so bas covid excuse rang somewhat hollow epilogue i got refunded most of my money from the flights i booked with ba although they refused to refund my bhd  lhr flights because who knows i also lost the money i had spent on a hotel and half of the money i had spent on booking airport transfers given the cavalier attitude ba seem to have to bookings and their indifference to ruining weeks of preparation on my part and the fact that i lost a not inconsiderable sum of money ive decided to avoid ba from now on
 trip verified   check in well organised no lounge in cancun efficient boarding process given water bottle before take off no welcome drink now covid rules are being relaxed this needs to change menu good and food acceptable staff were experienced and well organised and gave a very slick on board experience managed to sleep a few hours for the first time my tagged luggage was off quickly this may reflect the fact that our flight was the only one into gatwick at that time
 trip verified   departure lgw north so aspire lounge bag from fine lounge basic on time departure cabin crew welcoming but only given menu water and amenity pack looks like some of white company bedding options removed lunch was fine and good pre meal drinks service not complete return to old days but getting there flight generally good early touch down club world luggage off last which meant a wait of  minutes for luggage
not verified   booked flight six months before travel then month before the flight ba cancelled the flight giving the option to rebook for another day  bearing in mind that people have work and school that wasnt ideal on top of booked parking for over three weeks we rebooked the flight as suggested by them and a week later ba cancelled the rebooked flight we were told that we will receive a refund within  working days over two weeks passed and i called again i was informed that they cant give a time frame for processing refunds and no refund issued yet ba representative refuses to give contact details to the manager they cut the phone 
not verified   the airline cancelled my initial return flight with a  hours layover in london and my only option was to book the next flight that has a  hours layover thats before i board the flight to toronto while i understand schedule changes and do my best to stay positive and supportive i contacted the airline asking for upgrades to a best seat i asked for access to the airport lounge during my prolonged stay in the airport they denied my ask no explanations and no empathy not only that but they ignored my subsequent ask to provide a path to escalation again not the change in schedule not the extra  hours layover time just the way they chose to treat a customer who didnt do anything wrong except trusting them with his commute 
not verified   i was traveling with my wife in business class from seattle to bangalore via connecting flight in london and we reserved our seats together while booking the tickets but mysteriously they changed it later and when we got our boarding pass they assigned h and d called several times but they couldnt do anything and gave us explanations like may be some one else needed those seats and there are no other seats together available when we boarded the whole plane was empty and still they didnt allow us to seat together 
 trip verified   i usually avoid ba because of its appalling customer service and sneaky extra charges but this flight was my only option note that ba actually charges for seat preselection in biz class   uk pounds in this case does any other airline in the world dare do that i saved the money and waited until checkin to choose my seat for free the seats were bas universally derided cramped across backtofront configuration where you stare into the face of your seat mate an arms length away no other airline ever came up with this awkward arrangement  i wonder why no preflight drink was offered at meal time i selected one of the three main offerings only to be told it wasnt available  even though there were only  people in my  seat biz section the seat area has practically no storage except a tiny drawer at ankle level that is inaccessible when the seat is in lie flat position the bed is the narrowest i have experienced in biz class and is also very hard the cabin was very cold and the blanket very thin i had to raid blankets from two other seats just to stay warm the amenity kit is the smallest ive ever seen in biz class  it fits in the palm of the hand all in all this uncomfortable miserly experience is hardly worth the  that ba charges for this route i used miles to pay for my ticket  but of course got whacked with bas unique and notorious fuel surcharge fee of  for using miles
not verified   aktion airport has only recently opened its new facilities and checkin and departure certainly seemed very clean and efficient although admittedly its only having to cope with a low passenger load at present it was good to see that checkin carefully scrutinised lateral flow certificates and passenger locator forms thanks to just  passengers on board with more than half in club europe the flight took off ahead of time service was a little perfunctory and the food was more reminiscent of economy than business class with too much prepackaging  the covid effect presumably arrival into t was also comfortably ahead of schedule and although we were dreading many hours of queuing at border control we were through the egates and collecting our luggage just  minutes after landing
 trip verified   i want to say a big thank you to kahina ladjouze after frustratingly missing my flight due to m road closures she helped me secure and book the next day flight without additional charges i am really grateful
 trip verified  after sixteen months of being grounded by covid it felt almost surreal to be back in t heading for what to us was essential summer sun in greece t was blissfully quiet with no queues at checkin or security and even the galleries south lounge was less frenetic than usual despite families with kids similarly desperate to escape boris johnsons bully boy attitude ordering food and beverages from ones table seems something worth continuing avoiding all the wastage of endlessly replenished buffets the flights was very quiet with just  pax on board  of whom were in club europe boarding by row also seemed a welcome improvement on the previous groups service on the flight was good and the food was of the usual doco quality landing was ahead of schedule and we were through passport control in just a few minutes after a quick check of vaccination certificates and the passenger locator form overall a thoroughly reassuring coming out of covid experience
 trip verified  ba cancelled flight in dec  refund was promised in voucher form by call center we are now  months down the line  calls of which each is  min waiting time and  email reminders conclusion is that they are just going in circles to avoid issuing any voucher head of call center is keeping to her empty promises
 trip verified  fantastic flight down to heathrow crew doing their best to keep everyone happy in challenging times nice to see they have introduced a free snack and water its a start
 trip verified   boarding and disembarking were greatly organised passengers were boarded at the gate by seperate rows from the backside to the front business minimizing the possiblity for jamming same at disembarking passengers were asked to remain seated then row per row was called crew members were supporting the process what could be improved distribute handsanitizer during boarding when snack was distributed my row  business was overlooked for some reason after a while my seat neighbour highlighted that we did not get food  staff was surprised and fixed it this was my first flight since one year and i appreciated the covid measures taken by ba  still it left some strange experience
 trip verified  this was not my best experience with ba thus far as there were a couple of disappointments i was happy with the fast baggage checkin this was a bus gate which is not my favourite thing but not a blemish on the airline the covid protocols are not as robust as they should be particularly attendants need to be armed with sanitizer at the cabin entrance there was a big mix up which i find inexcusable  i and another passenger were allocated the same seat on the same plane causing a few anxious moments and the friendly attendant had to get me another seat but i dont expect such at this level bottles of water were offered to every passenger which was welcome the plane arrived  minutes late
 trip verified   ok flight apart from they cancelled the majority of the outbound and crammed everybody on one flight after having my return cancelled  times i opted for a voucher so i could rebook a new route i had not been informed before requesting the evoucher and i would need to call up to rebook im in a different country and the phone tariffs are extortion so not only was my flight cancelled  times i wasnt offered an option to rebook a new flight online i was inconvenienced every step of the way
 trip verified  absolutely appalling experience british airways unfortunately has lowered its standards and to my dismay ive been recently having a much better flying experience with budget airlines rather than ba customer service representatives are completely clueless unprofessional and not bothered  i recently had my flight cancelled on  occasions and the staff werent interested in helping me return home
 trip verified  had booked the above mentioned flight but the travel restrictions changed a week before the travel dates the airline didnt notify me until i learned that i could not fly with the airlines only at the airport when i went for checkin it was a single ticket with the company and they said they didnt realise i was flying from canada to india via london the restrictions didnt allow any via flights but were ok with direct ones when i booked a single ticket from canada to india how come they didnt realise i couldnt fly no refund at all gave me a credit for me to travel anytime in the next two years but i dont have any travel plans for the next two years that means my money is gone when talking to representatives they ridiculously put everything on the website agents which was onetravel the worst experience ever with an airline am a frequent flyer was trying ba for the first time but now i guess i am never going to fly with you on my return journey the other flight gave me a full refund when the new travel restrictions didnt allow them to take me a poor show with ba
 trip verified   my return flight from antigua to london was cancelled  times when i call to ba several times their computer system didnt work and they couldnt issue new ticket as the result i had to pay airport price for baggage as i couldnt pay online without ticket they promised to give me compensation of hotel stay food and travel if complete online form when i done it i was asked to submit expenses but link provided was to lost baggage expenses not what i claimed i replied that link is wrong and asked for correct link they replied that they wouldnt compensate anything 
not verified    cancellations for  month applying vouchers only to find out they dont work after new cancellation terrible stammers do not recommend to anyone in covid restrictions
 trip verified   i had travelled to india for an eye surgery on my flight back to london heathrow i was assisted by a member of the cabin crew madeline thomas she was an amazing person as she made sure i was feeling okay as i had come back from my surgery and was traveling by myself she was more then a nurse and took care of my needs like a mom she also made sure i had eaten my food and stood by next to me as i was feeling awful because i was in lot of pain
not verified   i was travelling back from mexico city on a business trip fully aware of the covid safety restrictions at the moment which the staff do an admirable job with  but nevertheless a lot to say on the state of ba first at the moment firstly  no lounge at all at mexico city terminal  theres a paid lounge but the check in staff wouldnt help with the details mexico city terminal  has functional lounges for aeromexico working not good enough for an expensive ticket finally got to board and the staff are incredible  but throughout they were super apologetic as to what was to come the food was literally inedible in first and staff offered commented as much every time so for an  hour trip in first the option really was chocolate or crisps the first suite on the flight had visible signs of wear and tear and needs some attention the seat would not easily convert to a bed it had scuff marks around it and generally looked a bit shabby again not what youd expect from a premium product i left my watch on the flight in error and contacted ba immediately about this despite assurances that they have a comprehensive cleaning process during covid my watch was never found ba has outsourced their lost and found service to a separate company and in the process they have completely washed their hands on helping out customers given that i told them specifically where id left the watch i can only assume that one of the cleaning staff decided to keep it all in all you pay premium on a flight for additional service ba isnt offering it at the moment if it is essential that you have to fly really dont bother with first unless you have to  or go to another airline the company just dont care
not verified   charge  fee to make an amendment to a booked holiday well in advance absolutely disgraceful their site says  fees for amendments and when you ring up they say that you ticked the terms and conditions box and refer to page  of terms and conditions and use it to charge you an extortionate amount  i received nothing but bad attitude and rudeness from the representative
not verified   good service the whole way nothing exceptional but it was only a short flight plane was clean and refreshments were provided my only issue is that the flight was packed  understandable as it was just before chirstmas but surely it is not wise to have strangers sitting so close to each other during a pandemic even with the masks my return flight was cancelled but it was easy to transfer to a new flight so no issues there either  just hoping for a little more personal space next time also wifi did not work i also liked that they had a system for boarding and disembarking to avoid everyone rushing at the same time brought in for the pandemic im sure but i hope this is something they continue into the future as it made the experience much more pleasant value for money marked down only because the christmas flights were so expensive to be expected though i know
not verified   i entered the plane with a bunch of white flowers and a flight attendant joked that i should have felt obliged to bring the flowers when she realized that i was going to my mothers funeral with the flowers she was apologetic she had no idea why i was bringing in flowers but the crew were very nice to me during this flight
 trip verified   i was supposed to fly with aeroflot on the rd of december to moscow but because russia has closed its borders like the majority of other countries the flight was canceled and i couldnt get home ive also tried to fly through antalya but the same situation occurred on my third try i came to heathrow and tried to fly away to cairo i was declined by another company then i went to british airways starting from testing because egypt requires tests as stressful as the whole situation was the employees were outstanding im not sure is it connected to ba but still i want to mention this the crew was very helpful and extremely understanding very professional and urgent to help they have been a great help and i am very gracious for this i want to separately point out one employee  shanell if i am not mistaken who works at collision testing center in heathrow terminal  she is a savior and most importantly a human which is very rare nowadays carrying on i went to ba checkin but unfortunately couldnt do it as my results didnt go through yet however another outstanding employee who provided great help called her colleagues and arranged for the booking to be frozen until the results arrive ive come to her  times with additional questions and every time she was very patient professional and happy to help after i got my results i came back to heathrow on th but unfortunately there were no flights to cairo the situation became even more complicated i will spare the details however here again brilliant employees of ba offered their personal assistance and showed sympathy and humanity towards me the nicest lady ive ever met unfortunately i didnt catch her name but i am aware it was her first day at ba and that she is egyptian followed me throughout my struggles offered me emotional and professional support she tried to find any possible ways for me to get back home and actually did she was open to any kind of help and was enormously helpful for which i cant thank her enough she also asked her colleague to help me which he kindly did  lastly the nice lady shame i dont know her name also shared my struggles with her colleague mani who came to substitute her on the position he was very friendly and attentive as well talked me through the process offered different ways i can stay at the airport gave his phone to call and offered to drop me off at the hotel which he did not have to do whatsoever to conclude i merely want to thank all of these individuals one more time as they have been a great help both in physical and mental aspects i honestly do not know what would i do if i havent met them i dont know was i just lucky to meet these people or all ba employees are of the same morality but i do want to thank ba for hiring and providing jobs for these great human beings as well as upholding the standard for other airlines for some people the help that was provided to me might seem like a normal thing to do however for me it was a pleasant and so much needed surprise as no one in
 trip verified   dubai to london on th december flight was ok  seat comfortable enough crew reasonably friendly but my food was gross  both flights almost full with little social distancing and plenty of mixed groups sat next to each other lots of passengers with masks below nose or not on at all when coming back to heathrow many seemed to have below their nose announcement made at the beginning about masks crew challenged a couple of people at beginning of flight for not having them on or below nose but seemed to give up at the end when leaving plane good number had already taken off yet nothing on way back not a single maskless or incorrectly worn mask challenged a guy opposite me had his mask below nose the whole flight he had a conversation with several attendants neither of whom said anything  not like the crew were busy either did  services the whole flight then rest of the time didnt see them of course flying in these times is a risk but those risks can be reduced by passengers wearing masks enforced by the airlines
 trip verified  this is my first flight since january we have had three cancellations which ba handled superbly but this flight went ahead check in at lhr was fine no fast track se unity at t galleries south lounge open they have an app system it seemed to work well and my breakfast arrived quickly followed this with a shower they are openlimited hours flight on time and well presented a staff worked hard nice drinks run the packed lunch was not dissimilar to the old short haul economy product but was fine in these times landed on time priority baggage cane off late overall happy with product and would use again
not verified   i had a direct flight from london to lahore and travelling with them was a nightmare they did not have milk for my sons bottle didnt even give warm water for his formula milk no kids meals no snacks meal portion size was tiny  glass of juice you literally have to beg them for drinks water etc staff was so rude and treated us like trash if you compare them with emirates i would give emirates  and british airways  its not at all child friendly i will never travel with them again
not verified   overall i have to say i am really pleased with the service ba provided given the circumstances which must be particularly challenging for airlines i had to call ba a few times regarding both my outbound and return flight and i would rate their customer service  everyone i talked to was extremely friendly and helpful one employee even tried to help me figure out the recently updated arrival regulations from an italian website and listened to my rant about constantly changing restrictions and quarantines i was refunded promptly for part of my flight that had been cancelled and i was able to change my return flight to a completely different route and date with only a minimal charge they have really shown flexibility here which is needed when travelling in  the flight itself was fine and i appreciate that food and drink options are currently a bit limited given that everyone should wear their mask as much as possible rather than sipping tea the one thing  which i mean as constructive criticism though  i think ba could improve is a little more exchange with their destination airports the arrival sheets for italy we were given on the flight were outdated and the ground staff in heathrow in charge of the boarding procedure did not even know that swab tests were now mandatory for arrivals in italy when i asked him whether he knew any details of what to expect in venice thats fine on the first day after yet another update but this rule had been in place for  days on the day i travelled overall my experience with ba was very positive though and i am happy to spend a little more on my flight than i would with some cheaper airlines for the great customer service i received
 trip verified  i am extremely pleased with british airways as they refunded my tickets munichlondon citymunich within  working days in a friendly and professional manner the difference between british airways and lufthansa is night and day friendly professional and prompt are  adjectives to describe ba while lufthansa is best summed up as arrogant impossible to contact and ignorant well done and best wishes to all at british airways
 trip verified   boarding and checkin formalities are very nice check in help desk was very helpful and supportive everything was nice except food i am vegan and there was no food availability for vegetarian passengers if not preordered my flight was  hour journey from london to bangalore and i was hungry
 trip verified   i have always had great flights with british airways but this time the experience was absolutely amazing as this was my th flight i decided to celebrate it in club europe which turned out to be a perfect decision the stewards working in club made me feel special and delivered a professional and personalised service and were kind and chatty although the cabin crew was the best part of the flight other features didnt let me down either efficient business class check in at warsaw cosy executive lounge preludium with attentive and helpful staff well organised boarding although no priority for club europe because of corona the aircraft was very fresh and clean seats were comfortable with enough legroom adjustable headrests and power ports the on board service is different than before corona times but its still very good tasty lunch box from doco with fresh chicken sandwich oriental vegetable salad and and amazing chocolate mousse the choice of drinks was wide including a very good quality champagne from nicolas feuillatte all in all a perfect flight experience with british airways everything i expected from this flight was fulfilled the one thing i can complain about is baggage handling at heathrow we waited around  mins for luggage and they were also delivered irrespecutful of club europe priority
 trip verified   we had a flight to santorini from lhr at am as the flight was full we had to check in all our luggage we arrived at the airport at am and the queue for checkin was incredibly long because some desks were closed it took us over  minutes to arrive to a desk and when we arrived we were told that the checkin had closed at am and that we had missed the flight british airways staff did not offer us to jump the queue at anytime the lady at the desk booked us on a flight to athens instead telling us that the costs to reach santorini would be reimbursed we had to book two tickets worth  for a flight to santorini on the same day we have just received a response from the customer relations service telling us that we would get nothing 
 trip verified   my flight from los angeles to paris via london was delayed due to late inbound aircraft due to mechanical and so i missed my connexion in london and arrived in paris  late and missed my onward connexion on air france and had to overnight on my own dime in paris i applied for compensation lawfully due me through ec but their customer relations department refused by carelessly determining that my flight had arrived in london under the hour delay window for compensation even though my final was clearly paris and their cr agent acknowledged this after i pointed out the error she ignored me so i filed a claim with the centre for effective dispute resolution and ba sent them a defences they claim i traveled on af and arrived in london ahead of schedule the truth is that ba at lax rebooked and reticketed me on that flight however af refused to accept me and my baggage unless i paid them a surcharge so ba then rebooked me on flights to have me arrive very late into paris and misconnect and have to overnight there i do not know which is more shocking that ba would lie to the authorities in order to support their indefensible position or that their agents do not know how to read a passenger name records air history
 trip verified   i was deeply unimpressed with the lack of social distancing on my flight the plane to london was  or more full and no social distancing could be applied a number of people wearing face masks incorrectly over mouth or as a chinstrap throughout the flight and there was a fair amount of time when masks were off for the free snack small bag of crisps and ml of water  it seems crazy to allow a considerate amount of time with masks off or inappropriately worn in such a small space with no safe distance whatsoever also only the absolute minimum of service which given covid is understandable but makes the flight really boring  or not since some excitement was provided by turbulence with very little information from the flight deck disembarkation was chaotic to say the least but terminal  was empty and vast enough to allow to finally distance an upgrade for  euros one was was available but it didnt seem to make sense at least they departed on time and the plane appeared reasonably clean
 trip verified  newcastle to london heathrow with british airways i was pleasantly surprised plane was on time and spotlessly clean professional staff bottle of water crackers and crisps handed out lovely deplaning with special covid social distancing system working well
 trip verified   due to the coronavirus situation i bought a return ticket back to my home country singapore from london where i currently reside because the first wave of asia in march was done i was due to fly back to london on th august  and my flight got cancelled before my flight cancellation i got an email from the airline that i could apply for a voucher if my flight ever got cancelled so i applied for an online voucher but i was told that i am not eligible to get a voucher because i have done the london to singapore leg a month later i tried again to redeem for a voucher and somehow i was successful but to redeem the voucher i have to call to redeem the voucher which i think it is a complete joke and i was put on hold for many hours
 trip verified   british airways canceled my flight to london on june  due to covid it is july  and they still have not refunded my money ive reached out to executives after trying the usual customer service path nothing has worked they will not call me and will not provide me any resolution they are blatantly ignoring emails asking for help avoid british airways service is nonexistent and they will keep your money they are keeping almost us of our money
 trip verified   london to frankfurt i made the mistake of exchanging my april flights with ba for a voucher because of the travel disruption due to the pandemic big mistake ba has failed completely and does not seem to care i tried to book an august flight using the voucher but frlights cannot be booked online using a voucher you have to wait for hours on the phone to speak to someone customer service tried to charge me twice the original cost then no email confirmation for hours after i chased it up another long wait on hold email confirmation showed they had booked the wrong outbound date  service supervisor denied any error on their part and refused to rebook for correct date or give a refund a few days later i started all over again and booked an alternative outbound date still not the one i wanted but better  and  weeks later ba cancelled the return flight so i called for a refund to be told if it hasnt appeared in my account after  days to get back in touch  things go wrong its how you deal with problems that mark out good customer service ba hasnt a clue
 trip verified  ba cancelled my flight to lyon marchapril  because of the corona crisis i could not obtain a refund as the ba website and telephone service made this impossible it just sent me round in circles so i opted for a future travel voucher as this could be obtained via the website i have now tried to use the voucher for a flight to munich and was informed by the website that i have to call ba for this the silver card member phone number is inaccessible as ba has reduced telephone access to one number i have now called this number five times each time i was told to call at another time as in these difficult times they had to protect staff this is exactly the same message that i received the many times i called for a refund is ba not honouring their voucher system trying to fob off customers and keep their money this is appalling business practice
 trip verified   a short hop from london to edinburgh in november   efficient clean and punctual the airport experience was straightforward and i think flying from city you get simplicity but miss out on the bigger aircraft which are a bit more comfortable i got my luggage quickly at the other end and i appreciated having a wide range of flight times to choose from
 trip verified   total rip off british airways cancels flights due to pandemic covid  when i use the voucher they issued me they want me to pay a additional  for a first class seat british airways way to rip people off and profit from a world pandemic 
not verified   i booked flights to rome from the us and then home through london to lax in february of this year for the st of august i booked through american airlines and then i paid for seat selection for  people through the ba website paying us  in total with the pandemic it is now impossible for me and my group to travel to italy and england on this trip as  we are not allowed to travel outside the us  as americans we are not allowed to travel to italy or england and  the us government has not processed one of the passport renewal we need to fly which was mailed in early february i had to cancel all of our hotels airbbs car and train reservations over the last week in order to qualify to obtain refunds andor vouchers ive tried to reach british airways customer service a number of times finally got through today after an hour on hold i asked how to obtain a refund or voucher for the business class seat selection that i had paid for and was told that i will lose the money i paid that there are no refunds or vouchers allowed because i booked the trip through american airlines and not through british airways my understanding is that ba and aa have a partnership that should make it relatively seamless to book and travel on either or both partners though i was shocked at having to pay nearly  just to reserve our seats in business class but this is apparently not the case i was told that if ba cancels the two flights that we are booked on that i might be able to get either a voucher or a refund i was prepared today to accept a voucher that i could use when i rebook this trip for  as i understand that ba and all airlines are suffering financially as much as i am but i was not prepared to be totally ripped off by ba i cannot wait until the first flight is supposed to fly august st to cancel this as i will lose the money and miles i paid american airlines for this flight i am at a loss as to what i can do to handle a situation that is totally out of my control and for which an airline partner that i valued traveling on is refusing to offer a voucher or a refund i will never again do anything that gives revenue to british airways
 trip verified   i booked a trip to spain for midmarch  with american airlines british airways and iberia i needed to cancel this flight due to the pandemic and travel ban to europe that began in march i was able to change my flight at no cost which is great but given the fact that my flight left the day the travel ban began those tickets should have been refunded if i were to have boarded that flight i would have been quarantined in europe and would have faced a mandatory quarantine upon reentry to the us if i were able to return at all the fact that british airways did not cancel this flight is beyond me since i do not know who in their right mind would have traveled to spain with the travel ban enforced the response i received from british airways is that it does not matter the reason unless they cancel the flight no refund or voucher is available im very disappointed in the response from them during a global pandemic and will not book another flight with them
 trip verified   i booked london to tel aviv in jan  to attend a school reunion i booked economy ba then sent me an upgrade offer which i accepted at an additional  so i would fly premium in the new plane covid hit and they cancelled the flight no fault of theirs their subsequent behaviour was all their fault after a mammoth effort to contact them i was offered a full refund this took months and many calls to get and they deducted  as a service fee for the upgrade calls and emails all result in the same robotic response as you made a post booking change we are unable to offer a full refund 
not verified   i booked my honeymoon flight from san diego to barcelona in september  i have since needed to cancel this flight due to the pandemic and the uncertainty of travel especially to other countries i was able to change my flight at no cost which is great however this is my honeymoon and i paid in advance for seats to ensure i sat next to my would be wife this was more than  in additional cost the response i received from british airways is that it does not matter the reason unless they cancel the flight no refund or voucher is available i then asked if i wanted to make sure i sat next to my would be wife they expected me to pay again the answer was yes im very disappointed in the response from them during a global pandemic where travel is not safe and we have no idea when it will be safe again
 trip verified   this company is withholding my money after cancelling my flight due to the pandemic and have issued me a voucher even though i called to explain why a voucher is useless since we are under a travel bane initially they had said no refunds the only thing to do was get a voucher after we had ordered they announce you can get refund if flight is cancelled and you dont have voucher 
 trip verified   tokyo to london  hours without anything to eat because the sandwich i was given was inedible there was no bar service and soft drinks were pitiful with orange running out after a matter of hours total waste of money having paid for premium economy i am aware it was the beginning of the covid issues but the situation was appalling and has been made worse by a total lack of follow up service from british airways their attitude is unacceptable  it is all about money with them 
 trip verified   flight ba  on  february was delayed  mins due to mechanical in london and so i misconnected at london heathrow and arrived  hrs  mins late i requested compensation and was refused  for three emails they told me my flight to london was delayed  mins under the  mins floor and i continued to reply that i did not fly to london but to paris and arrived  mins late then they started writing that i was able to make my original connexion which is untrue i dont know whether to fault their greed at persisting in this lie or their incompetence
 trip verified   london heathrow to toronto my wife and i used avios and the ba amex companion voucher to get a very good deal to fly business class on our holiday i was also excited to fly on an a for the first time and it definitely lived up to my expectations the breakfast buffet in the ba lounge in heathrow t was okay not amazing and there was a good range of drinks and comfortable settees the aircraft felt very clean and fresh and had good mood lighting very comfortable spacious seats and large highresolution ife screens i like the moving map but my wife opted for the movies and was impressed with the selection available we both enjoyed the food and wines on board and it was a professional and friendly service from the cabin crew the a is a lot quieter than older aircraft like the  and 
 trip verified   my wife and i used avios and my ba amex companion voucher to get a very good deal for business class flights to our holiday before the coronavirus lockdown was on the horizon the checkin and security were very efficient and the lounge not belonging to ba was clean but had a more limited range of food than i would have expected boarding was very quick and cabin crew were friendly and professional i am a big fan of the iconic  but we flew out on one of bas new as and this brought home to me that the  business class is looking tired and old in comparison the seats were comfortable and the food was good but small and very low quality ife screen was behind the times however it was a night flight so i slept most of the journey except when there was moderate turbulence caused by strong tailwinds
 trip verified   i flew with ba recently from sydney to london deciding to return back home from travelling due to the coronavirus situation the first ticket i booked with them was via hong kong after booking hk closed its borders so i could no longer get this flight i rang up ba who advised that the hk flight was not yet cancelled on the system so they couldnt yet book me onto a new flight yet the customer service agent assured me he would ring me back at am the next day as it would be cancelled on the system by then and he would tell me what flight ba would be putting me on as a replacement am came and went the next day and i had not received a phone call i tried ringing to find out what was going on and was on hold for  hours and still no one answered i decided to book myself onto another flight as there were hardly any left available and i didnt want to end up stuck in australia i had not received the promised phone call or even an email to tell me what my replacement flight would be so felt i had no other choice when i got back home i raised this with ba they told me that i was supposed to process an involuntary change to get a replacement flight  that is not what the customer agent advised me id never even heard that term before he simply said ba would sort it out and put me on a replacement flight he didnt say i had to do anything so now because i was given the incorrect advice i am out of pocket by a considerable amount i raised it with the ba complaints team that i had been advised incorrectly and if i had been told i needed to do an involuntary change myself i would have done so they were extremely unhelpful and just said that they dont know why i was advised incorrectly and there is nothing they can do about it when i said that wasnt good enough they basically just fobbed me off and told me to go to a third party adjudicator if i wanted but they were not prepared to do anything  i will never use this airline again
 trip verified   during the time of covid it is normal that a airline has to cancel their flight im ok with that also when it means that i had to reorganize a few things whats definitely is not okay is the compensation via voucher  you cant use their voucher online or for a cheap flight  on the hotline they offer you no online fare and just way more expensive prices so stay far away from their voucher for me as a regular traveler i will avoid ba as much as possible in the future i even wont use my miles with ba
not verified   do not accept a british airways evoucher go for a refund i stupidly accepted  evouchers and they are a waste of time they have no flexibility and despite the fact that ba has money and air miles belonging to me i cannot redeem the voucher against a more expensive non air miles flight only an air miles flight that they dont have available at the time and route i want ba are trying every trick in the book to complicate frustrate and make rebooking difficult and worse still you cant redeem the cancelled flight voucher online only by speaking to the call centre which means hanging on for an hour or so every time you try to phone them i was a loyal silver card executive club member and still am but after bas approach i will be avoiding them wherever possible in future
 trip verified   londonheathrow to warsaw on th march british airways stands out in many areas of the flight experience starting from check in and ending on the deplaning very friendly smiling chatty people throughout my journey including the lovely captain who gave all the information about delay missed slot and new departure time what is also really appreciated in those coronavirus times he entered the passenger cabin before takeoff without any mask whatsoever and assured us this aircraft is so modern and has such good air filters that we are safe here the boarding procedure was very well organised no chaos with  groups boarding sequentially i didnt try the paid marksspencer on board service but i think it would be a nice touch to get some refreshments free the one thing i can pick on is the cleanliness of the rear toilet whilst the rest of the cabin was impeccably clean the toilet was filthy 
 trip verified  just before the borders were closed in south africa due to corona virus i went to the airport to find out if the flight scheduled will fly as planned there was no international flight customer service staff available so i was not able to get a response the only number available was a uk number which will cost me more than a flight to enquire next day i managed to get on board the flight sadly due to my fault i forgot my laptop inside the aircraft on arrival to terminal  i was one of the last passengers to leave the plane i realised my mistake after i passed security and i was not allowed back into the airport to collect my laptop which is fair enough and i understand why i could not go back to the aircraft they gave me a number to call and i have been calling the number since march so far it has been zero positive response because they are using a third party company to help you which has zero interest to help you find your lost items basically ba does not have means in place for passengers to find their items my laptop was left inside the flight hence it is impossible for crew staff and cleaning staff to not find it hence i just can not understand how they can not find it bearing in mind it was  left inside the plane lessons learned avoid if you can 
 trip verified   at checkin desk at t heathrow was told by ba staff that sweden only allowing swedish nationals into country this was contrary to advice on swedish government website  i rang the border control office at arlanda airport they confirmed that eueftaeea  uk nationals were clear to enter the country i offered the phone to ba staff to clear up any confusion they declined and then changed their story saying it was their own company policy i spent the next hour trying to get through to ba on the telephone for a refund the calls were being disconnect due to high call volumes  ba standard of service compared to the other major european airlines was dishonest and obstructive furthermore if the other airlines can provide customer support on the telephone or via email at this time ba should be able to do the same while inflight staff at ba are still terrific they are let down by the worst sort of management bureaucracy
not verified   i booked a flight with them on  of march but was unable to flight to the destination due to coronavirus restrictions since then i am trying to call them every day i also filled out the form to request a refund but no reply in a week today i finally managed to spoke to the lady on the phone from their cs but she just directed me to their website or she gave me another number this number directed me to call again the first number i called already after minutes of waiting again i spoke to another lady she asked me for my reference and said she will transfer me to someone else when she hang up on me unbelievable so you can not even call them and when you finally speak with someone no help at all i never thought company like this have this poor customer service especially in situation like this with the corona virus
 trip verified   a journey of  halves before hand multiple lies and lack of information from the ba website they cancelled my flight but they werent honest about what they had done and lied they claimed that i could rebook and showed lots of flights  none were in fact scheduled to fly but ba claimed that they were full then my return booking completely disappeared and the website claimed that all journeys complete website at no point gave any indication about how difficult it was getting to fly from the usa to uk impossible to get through to ba in london usa ba much better  a total wait of  hour  minutes to make  calls staff at the call centre efficient and helpful chaos at chicago as most passengers had american issued boarding passes for the ba flight to london and ba werent accepting those boarding passes no explanation for the change in policy everyone i saw merely handed in the american boarding pass and was given a ba boarding pass on the plane the staff were excellent  as usual food was good  verging on very good breakfast a little small but tasty i even got a nd cup of tea journey smooth with some sleep i stopped flying ba for  years because the head office is so poor  the staff on the ground are good but ba as an organisatiion comes over as badly managed eg over securing clients data telling passengers what is going on running a decent frequent flier programme design of the business cabin stepping over the legs of the next passenger to go to the loo and so on i only fly ba because of the lack of choice on most routes  whenever there is an alternative i try that not american airlines which somehow is consistently poorer than ba
 trip verified   i flew to vancouver mid march to see my mother then in hospital three days after arrival my mother passed away and i subsequently needed tochange my return flight to be able to attend her funeral i tried to manage my booking online as ba suggest but because i had bought a package that included car hire the ba site said i was unable to change this online and i had to call their customer services i spent over  hours hanging on a telephone trying to call the numbers listed online  i set up conversations facebook and twitter they went unanswered on the second day of my telephone ordeal i actually called a different number and spoke to a guy in holidays who said he couldnt help me either but that he would try and add me to the queue for the help line when this was finally answered after another hour and a half of waiting i managed to blurt out my ref number nothing else before that call was disconnected thankfully the one person i had briefly spoken to in the duty office that night then emailed me back and i was able to have a conversation about my need to change flight this change took about  minutes over a few emails but the person helping me couldnt extend the car hire because the vehicle had already been collected the only way this could be managed would be by myself calling the car hire company but two days previously when i tried to manage my booking online i was told i couldnt do this because i had bought a package and that this could only be done by ba i do totally understand the turmoil caused by covid but never again ba
not verified   very disappointed that ba are not making it straightforward to claim a refund on cancelled flights back due to covid effectively holding onto my money illegally do whats right and make it straightforward to do it online a voucher is not sufficient or get more phone operators the virus is stressful enough without you making to check your site for updates and a  hour wait on the phone very disappointed  i expect much better from you
not verified   i booked my flights to the uk in may  and had to cancel our trip to the uk on march     days prior to leaving because a travel ban was going to start on march   and because i am older and have preexisting health conditions my doctor asked me to postpone our trip the british airways customer care associates i talked with were great and caring and they were able to issue us travel credit for tickets that were nonrefundable now the problem is i need to rebook and use the travel credit by may  for travel to the uk by may  or lose all the credit from our trip how can i make travel arrangements by may  with the coronavirus out of control throughout the world and travel bans in place i understand ba has policies in place but i cannot understand how you can expect someone to make travel arrangements while the world is dealing with covid i feel this timeline is unfair to any consumer who has trust with their preferred airline my preferred airline is still british airways british airways needs to reevaluate their policies during a world crisisand make adjustments as needed to be fair to consumers who trust them whether a consumer has purchased refundable or nonrefundable tickets should not matter because forcing a consumer to rebook while a world pandemic is happening and not adjusting your policies to the situation can change your loyal customers remember there are many other airlines out there to choose from the coronavirus is something that no one has any control of i guess the bottom line is i think british airways needs to put some common sense to their policy i want to rebook and travel but i am hesitant to this at this time hopefully may  this pandemic is over for all of us 
 trip verified   mumbai to london heathrow i wish to highly commend the professionalism of the stewards on this flight someone had erroneously accused me of being on a flight from goa to mumbai and coughing throughout the journey categorically i was not on that flight but in his agitation the passenger could not hear me when i repeatedly said so the stewards dealt with this situation with tact absolute professionalism and great courtesy all the staff must be working in difficult circumstances at the moment they are putting themselves at more risk than most to ensure that holiday makers and business people can get home safely and i wish to thank our crew in particular for what they did
 trip verified   i have a booking for march th london heathrow to valencia and ba still show this flight as operating and are not providing any refund option the ba website was updated on  march to state were working closely with the foreign  commonwealth office fco to continue flying where travel restrictions allow and where it is safe to do so i then checked the fco website that was also updated on  march and it states the foreign and commonwealth office fco advises against all but essential travel to spain so it is clear that ba deem it safe to fly to spain despite the fco statement i know the airline is suffering like the rest of uk industry and business but how can they get away with such deceitful practices it is clear they are expecting customers to change their booking to the future and keep the funds and are not complying with the british fco advisory is this actually legal
not verified  london gatwick to funchal british airways are still forcing people to fly to madeira when the foreign office has advised against anything other than essential travel my wife and her friend were due to fly to madeira on  march for a weeks holiday when we found out that the fo had advised against travelling there the madeira government had ruled that new arrivals would spend  days in quarantine no matter how long their stay thats a week longer than their proposed stay her friend contacted ba but was told they could not have a refund as the flight was still on they offered a voucher if this is an example of bas customer service i am not surprised they are in trouble
 trip verified   lower deck club class seat with the current awful narrow business class facing seats british airways premium passengers are treated with indifference at best and club class is simply terrible my food was not fit for consumption wifi broken crew morale low ife quality a bad joke to add insult to injury the  amenity packs are contemptible what makes ba management think that business people require or indeed would retain a package of socks mask plastic pen and disposable tooth brush the ongoing decline of this oncegreat national airline is palpable 
 trip verified   london to new york jfk another grim flight with british airways in club class on a tired and old b the business class at ba is by far the worst in the industry the dreaded ying  yang configuration is going to be with us for some time sadly in flight entertainment with tiny screen no hd and poor movie selection wifi did not work as usual food continues to be desperately poor and crew were rather keen to disappear quickly this airline needs major overhaul and investment in new aircraft and seats
not verified   diabolical that british airways are still forcing people to fly to madrid when other airlines have cancelled their flights and the foreign office have advised against anything other than essential travel what a way to treat their customers if that is how they are going to treat people it is hardly surprising they are in trouble
 trip verified   frankfurt to buenos aires via london in october  the aircraft is very old with small screens and ample entertainment which becomes an issue flying hrs the  hour layover was a complete disaster the staff was unfriendly and inconsiderate to me 
 trip verified   london to paris return group booking cancelled i know the current coronavirus is causing problems for any airline but ba appears as usual to have no contingency plans to handle extra number of enquiries and it is proving impossible to speak with them after the constant it debacles this airline has surely it is time for heads at the top to roll cancelled my booking for flight refund online but they do not return the seat booking fee and you have to do this afterwards however the manage booking page wipes all preferences to your booked seat numbers and you cannot complete the form without this information a  year old child could improve upon the user unfriendly app and website that ba currently has and my patience of being loyal to ba for over  years i might add has run out the management of this airline appear to live in a conceited bubble and have no idea what is going on at the front line
 trip verified   london city to berlin on th march flight got canceled the lady at the counter was extremely unfriendly and arrogant extremely rude staff and service this is no way to treat passengers especially not if the expensive flight is cancelled
 trip verified   london to beijing in january  ba has really upped their game now a few years back i took ba the experience was really disappointed and avoid them since however my recent flight is good the flight was delayed for  hour due to mechanical reasons but get back majority of the delay in the air food is tasty and crews are not hesitate to provide more if you are still hungry the drinks are offered in the promote manner and crews are really willing to engage with you in the gallery when majority of the passengers fall asleep seat is a bit tight but understood i am flying economy so this is bearable the return flight has been cancelled it takes like  calls  emails and they finally sorted out our flight this could be improved but i appreciate it is not easy to change you to an airline which is not bas partner overall ba has really improved the game and the friendly and professional crews are the best in the world
 trip verified   hong kong to london great airline indeed staff were friendly and helpful the aircraft was very clean the crews are diverse will definitely fly again
 trip verified   mumbai to london the check in process was quick efficient and friendly unfortunately there was a two hour delay on departure but ba kept us informed and we were given a free food and drink offering from the food court information explanation and apology over the delay was given by the first officer which we were happy with the entertainment screens were a little temperamental to begin with but they eventually worked good service and friendly attitude from the cabin crew made the long flight easier though very happy with the service
 trip verified   london to delhi this booking was part of a holiday group format so we had to check in as opposed to bag drop according to the check in screen all zones were applicable for our destination but we were sent from one zone to the next which given the size of the t check in hall wasnt helpful eventually we managed to find assistance but it was very much a shrug of the shoulder attitude  especially when we discovered we were seated separately it was only when a family with two young children had been split up that we were able to switch seats fortunately the cabin crew made up for this by providing a fabulous flight with great service and positive friendly attitude i actually praised them and told them that my faith in ba had been restored
 trip verified  paris to london flight cancelled due to atc restrictions after storm ciara  and rebooked to a later flight which was delayed on top by  hours arrived in london  hours later than planned initially and ba refused to recognise any additional expenses because it was a forceful operational reason booked  flights to italy for march all cancelled last thursday booked lgwbgylgw and next day cancelled for last week of march a month away been a gold member of ba since  and after seeing their constant downgrades i will go back with airfranceklm for my travel needs ai found thr food and seats on euro business a shame
 trip verified   i flew from sydney to london to visit my seriously ill mother the second leg from singapore to london was with british airways my return flight from london to sydney was with british airways leaving  february on  february it became clear that mum did not have long to live i contacted ba who said i should be able to change my return date and asked me to send medical documentation which i did with an explanatory email sadly mum passed away very early on the morning of  february i contacted ba again the next day they said because i had booked through webjet i needed to contact them i phoned them they said they would contact ba no follow up from either when i phoned webjet again they said still no word from ba when i phoned ba again they said they couldnt help at this point i gave up and booked with qantas paying for another flight bas complete lack of compassion apart from a couple of platitudes and lack of interest in helping me in any way astounded me needless to say i will never use british airways again
not verified   gatwick to malaga nothing special nowadays theres unfortunately not much difference between ba  easyjet flight left gatwick late  arrived in malaga late ba seats no longer recline food and drinks are expensive their cream tea excludes tea lift your game ba your product just continues to get worse
 trip verified   vancouver to london there are time when british airways deserve to be ranked as one of the very best carriers this flight proves the point from the warm welcome at the door on boarding until deplaning at lhr the crew were outstanding friendly attentive and professional the dinner was excellent excellent choices on the menu accompanied by some decent wines i had a painful back from running a flight attendant provided some medication came back to my seat an hour or so later to check on me and remembered to ask me if the pain had subsided when i deplaned very thoughtful seat was comfortable and complemented by a proper cushion and a very nice quilted blanket ife good the b is showing its age but its still a wonderful iconic aircraft to fly on and ill continue to prefer it over the b 
 trip verified   i am flying london to seattle in business class in may  and british airways wants around  each way for me to choose seats all other airlines i have encountered allow business class passengers to choose seats at no additional cost they decided to change my seat for operational reasonss what could that reason be the plane is the same so ba takes  off me for me so that i can choose my seat and then changes my seat  without asking me what i get is an automated message the next time i log on to the ba website to tell me there is a number i can ring  minutes waiting for the phone to be answered and i give up 
 trip verified   london heathrow to nairobi ba first is so much weaker than that of middle eastern and asian airlines i despair the brightest spot of this trip was being able to use the cx lounge at heathrow t to cram  firstclass seats onto a  is quite an achievement but it is the food that is the standout problem on board it is poor and it is shameful that our flagcarrier represents britain so badly in this regards conversely the flight attendants were excellent in both directions i only flew first because bas business class is so poor but never again
 trip verified   dubai to london my husband and i traveled together he got business class my ticket was a last minute addon so was premium economy instead after we boarded my husband came to me to give me his pillow so i got settled and started sleeping i was woken up by a flight attendant who grabbed the pillow that my husband gave me and saying that there is a lady in business class is missing a pillow did i take the pillow i told her i didnt and the pillow was given to me i stood up and told her it wasnt ok for her to accuse me of stealing a pillow and ill show her whom my husband is who gave me the pillow i located my husband in the business class apparently his seat had  extra pillow and so he gave me the extra one he offered to give his pillow to the flight attendant who said there was no need and he could keep it
 trip verified   london to cape town gone are the days in which british airways was a great airline weird seat configuration service that needs training horrible food and no internet in business class are  basic services offered by most of the airlines but not by ba

 trip verified   johannesburg to dublin via london i get to the counter and require a transit visa since when and why if you are in the same terminal even there was no support guidance or remorse from the staff i also had a non refundable hotel booking in dublin ba need to communicate such changes
 trip verified   las vegas to paris via london the staff were great but the  was the most uncomfortable flight in business class ive experienced  the aisle seat felt like i was sitting in the aisle a business class configuration of  thats a tight squeeze andthere were backward facing seats the seats were not only uncomfortable but just so many things wrong with the configuration i was just glad i didnt pay full price for this flight

 trip verified   mexico city to manchester via london my plane from mexico city to london was smooth entertainment was quite nice and so was the food although i chose a window seat and was never informed it wasnt actually the window but a wall the crew was amazingly kind and lovely theyre always checking on you and we even got a magnum loved this airline for my first flight ever
 trip verified  london heathrow to sofia a good experience onboard one of bas recently refreshed a cabins although unfortunately without any inseat power supply contrary to what is stated on their website about which aircraft types were due to get inseat power following refresh another thing to add to the list of inconsistencies with the ba product however the flight overall was very good as usual an extremely efficient preflight experience at heathrows excellent t fast track security was fast as expected galleries club lounge was pretty good and not too crowded boarding was smooth with priority boarding honoured as usual the crew were excellent and provided a very attentive service with plently of drinks runs given the slightly longer distance of the flight the food pretty good for a shorthaul business class offering i found the seats to be pretty comfortable and legroom reasonable for a  ft  chap so overall a good experience with no major complaints
 trip verified   i was to fly to melbourne from manchester via london and singapore in july  arriving late to board my heathrow flight the checkinstaff discussed my dilemma with her supervisor only option being to find my way to heathrow i somehow managed to get to heathrow in time where only the singapore to melbourne boarding pass was issued i was told that because manchester to heathrow flight was missed my heathrow to singapore was cancelled 
 trip verified   madrid to london i keep giving ba the benefit of the doubt but things are getting worse not better this a has cramped business class seats no middle table any more and frankly this is a pathetic premium cabin despite every statement they make about catering improvements i simply refer to meal photos on this route in  or  to see they have severely cut back on meal portions and cost iberia staff in  madrid were all very nice cabin staff okay but overall club europe is not worth the money  dont waste your money on this  
 trip verified   prague to london this is the first time i have flown with british airways the flight departed earlier than intended and got to heathrow about  minutes early however at heathrow there was a plane in the way as we had arrived early a negative was at the checkin partly the websites fault as we had done the online check in we selected the amount of bags we each had it said we would have to pay extra and we spent forever at the checkin because we had to pay  for each bag apart from those negatives and the delay i would definitely fly this airline again
 trip verified   johannesburg to london whoever designed the refurbished galleries lounge at jnb has no understanding of acoustics as every syllable of a facetime conversation was audible  feet away add in different languages and some degree of inebriation as you have a recipe for an unrelaxing experience thankfully the upper deck of the a was more civilised with an efficient if slightly distant cabin crew who ensured that everyone was fed and watered by  hours after takeoff allowing plenty of time for sleep food was mediocre and ive given up expecting anything more from bas business class product the white company bedding is more of a gimmick than a genuine enhancement and breakfast has become rather perfunctory with no pastries or bread apart from a solitary croissant arrival at a chilly lhr was ahead of schedule and we were curbside  minutes after landing reliability is currently bas strongest card
 trip verified   las vegas to gatwick a very disappointing service for club world it felt like i was travelling in economy with attitude especially considering the very high cost of the flight ive paid half as much less for business class returns to australia we got off to a bad start when offered one third of a glass of champagne about  cm in the bottom of the glass my initial drink after take off was not what i ordered when i queried it i got a lecture on this was how it should be no wine arrived with dinner until i asked for it a second time out of stock of the first choice no second glass of wine offered yes i could have used the call button but  of a glass of champagne and one glass of wine being offered on a  hour business class flight other than the initial bottle of water and a glass of water with dinner no other water was offered until i got up and went to the galley to ask the good news is the food was good and well presented although the promised on the menu selection of pastries with breakfast were not served i later walked past the galley to see the crew eating them for their own breakfast we had dutifully filled in the preorder card for breakfast only to find we were being asked again at breakfast sleeping was impossible due to the temperature being so high i actually thought i had a fever i was so drenched in sweat until i spoke to a colleague who was the same im used to flying ultra long haul with middle eastern airlines so im used to hot cabins but this was crazy only when the crew dropped the temperature a few hours before landing presumably to wake us up was it bearable enough to sleep combined with the a very dry cabin air it was very unpleasant no need to say anything much about the eight across seating as i know the seats are being upgraded over the next few years other than they are very cramped if sitting next to a window i do like the semireclined position for take off and landing though i have fairly big shoulders and found the seat width very restrictive there is nowhere to put your spectacles or bottles of water if lying down being on the second aisle we had to join in with the economy passengers queuing to disembark so it wasnt quick at no point did any member of the cabin crew introduce themselves other than via a general pa announcement the seats i can forgive as they are being addressed but the service was budget airline level really ba you need to do much much better the ground staff in las vegas were fast friendly and efficient the lounge was something from the dark ages all s wooden panels
 trip verified   san diego to stockholm via london had i written this review immediately on landing it would have been zero out of ten but i realise this would be unfair ba is a game of two halves the inflight experience is immeasurably improved from a few years ago the food in club is excellent the cabin crew attentive and professional the pilots are the best in the industry and ife absolutely fine the club world product is competitive with the better european airlines such as lufthansa and streets ahead of most us carriers the problems start when anything goes wrong  which it frequently does given the mostly old fleet especially on noncore routes in my case the flight was cancelled due to the inbound aircraft an ancient  going technical then a comedy of errors first the hotel vouchers just said holiday inn there are about  in san diego cue hordes of passengers looking for shuttle buses in the wrong place arriving at hotels with no booking etc etc next the replacement flights the clunky app kept just saying error for some reason eventually the full website on a pc showed my replacement flights but no booking refs or any statement if these were being offered to me were confirmed or whatever on calling ba they wouldnt talk to me because i failed security i didnt know the billing address of the specific booking which was done by my companys travel department despite having a full executive club account that was associated with the booking and which they could have used the next day i went to take the replacement flights alaska airlines to newark then sas to stockholm despite getting a boarding card and making it to my seat on the plane i was pulled off minutes before takeoff ba had not paid for the flight a reservation had been created but no ticket issued ba then booked me on a roundabout route back via chicago plus a  hour layover from am to pm getting me home over  hours after my original reservation later i spotted that the next ba flight which would get me home much sooner now had tickets available online why was i not on this when i called they had no explanation and only agreed to exceptionally change my flight again after i complained about all of the above finally i arrived home after a  hour delay and a roller coaster of incompetence in summary when all goes well ba is better than it was and staff are doing a heroic inflight job but old planes rubbish back office it infrastructure and plain incompetence mean this airline can be hell if anything goes wrong and bear in mind i was travelling in business class who knows how they treat economy passengers
not verified   cape town to johannesburg the slow lounge at cape town continues to impress by the standard of service and the generous array of food and drink including ingenious winedispensing machines boarding was quick and takeoff was exactly on time there was some turbulence but the captain kept passengers well informed the club meal was the usual offering with the hot options displayed on a tray arrival was  minutes ahead of schedule
 trip verified  on th of december before my flights departure i got my purse stolen in nyc with all my money and my passport in it thanks to the kind strangers i managed to get to the danish embassy and get a temporary passport when i arrived at the jfk airport it was too late and i wasnt allowed to drop off my luggage with tears in my eyes i went to the desk where they sell tickets and the employee was so kind and helpful  she booked me on to the next flight for free got me through security without having to wait in the line and she informed the flight crew what happened when i finally sat down the flight crew were so kind and gave me water and food as i havent had any food for the whole day as i didnt have any money i want to say thank you for your service and kindness and for making sure that i got back to denmark safely i was overwhelmed with all the kindness from all the staff once again thank you
 trip verified   phoenix to london since moving to the usa ive been flying ba more than in the past and overall they provide a more than acceptable service if you choose your seat in club world carefully and the crew are in the right mood then they surpass expectations the new menus and service offering are significantly better than in the past and the wine list more interesting on this flight the crew were engaging and the food was good departed phx early and arrived into lhr early where immigration and baggage took minutes if you manage your expectations with ba then you wont be disappointed with club world
 trip verified  london heathrow to bangkok done this route a few times with british airways over the years first time and probably last in economy old plane needs upgrade poor entertainment system uncomfortable seats especially for  hour flight i know theyre starting to upgrade these planes but still a long time away the only saving grace was a superb cabin staff in economy
 trip verified   mumbai to boston via london my flight with british airways was really good the catering was excellent on both flights and even the service was good however some of the seats have very limited legroom due to the ife box blocking space in front of you also ba had misplaced my tennis racket which was checked in they have a really weird policy that you cant carry your single sports equipment as cabin baggage and instead you have to check it in the ground staff was rude at logan airport in boston also they took a week to deliver my racket to my house even though it arrived in boston  hrs after i had come even after contacting bas baggage customer service they were speaking rudely to me they always tried to cut my call in like  minutes without even listening to my concern british airways needs to improve their ground experience 
 trip verified  i purchased roundtrip tickets for my wife and i to travel from orlando florida to accra ghana and i purchased advance seat assignments unfortunately british airways only gave me the seats i paid for for one of four international legs our our roundtrip i have been fighting with british airways to get my refund for these seat assignments they have only provided me with refund of  despite several phone calls and filing multiple online calls and providing them with detailed my fightcontinues their customer service is really poor i will never purchase advance seat assignments with them again
 trip verified   toronto to geneva via london i stopped flying ba about three years ago after they dramatically downgraded their service apparently things have improved somewhat since so i decided to give them another try overall i was happy with my experience save for two major gripes on the plus side i flew on new aircraft which were comfortable albeit with the usual narrow seats for modern aircraft same with all airlines legroom on the  was generous and seemed to be more than the official  pilots were very good and informative as always with ba quality of food on longhaul has definitely improved since the bad old days of soggy pasta and droopy sandwiches i rather enjoyed the meals served which were on nice large trays the ife was just about adequate though surprisingly dated for such new aircraft cathay pacifics is far superior the two major downsides  the new basic economy fare it is really pesky and serves only to disgruntle passengers ba really need to get rid of it virtually everyone on longhaul has to check in a bag so please just include it in all airfare types if i wanted to be nickleanddimed id fly to gatwick on a charter airline also not being able to choose a seat even at the time of checkin is infuriating i was automatically allocated a middle seat even though the entire rear half of the plane was empty this just goes to show that you will get a middle seat unless you pay thankfully the lady at checkin changed it to a window seat free of charge after i asked nicely  no complimentary catering on shorthaul seeing as virtually all passengers flying tofrom heathrow are connecting tofrom longhaul flights with ba and have spent at least  on their airfare i resented a drink and snack not being included on the shorthaul segment of my trip ba should not be treating connecting passengers the same as those on lowcost airlines who only paid a few dollars for a short trip if ba would get rid of these two new features i would not hesitate to fly with them again as everything else about my trip was pleasant as it is i would still consider other airlines
 trip verified  hong kong to london heathrow with british airways one of the best flights ive had in a premium cabin the service seat food and wine are among the best ive experienced the only gripe i had was the cabin temperature which was quite warm and sleeping was quite impossible at first even with pyjamas on provided by ba the cabin attendant did my own bed and it was a nice touch i would not hesitate flying first class with ba on my next flight
 trip verified   san jose to amsterdam via london layout of boeing  cabin is poor with rearmost seat not having luggage bins row  d e and f in addition the crew fill the bins over the outer seats row  k j with their bags and blankets i would not recommend ba or the 
 trip verified   singapore to paris via london the flight was a ok dated seating with shakey arms not the most comfortable but a serviceable experience however our luggage was not loaded onto the flight the second time this happened now with ba and despite a  hour flight  hour stopover and  hour flight to paris ba did not make any effort to inform us at any time of the issue instead after travelling for around  hours we had to wait for the baggage to all come and clear before we realised ours was missing being a sunday and most shops close at lunchtime that also left little time to buy emergency items and the despite knowing they hadnt loaded the baggage they could not find a way to send it quicker than  hours after arrival meaning  out of  days in paris will be spent without luggage
 trip verified   warsaw to london everything went like clockwork and nothing could be disliked about this flight professional crew with beams on their faces new aircraft its important to choose a seat no further than row  in aneo as those seats are the old type pinnacle seats and have better legroom very informative captain who told us about expected turbulence before we had taken off very much appreciated on time landing and good atmosphere on board the food in euro traveller is unfortunately no longer free however being in bas executive club you can pay for the food  drinks with avios which is very convenient the only drawback i could find is a long queue to the bag checkin at warsaw airport   opened checkin counters for approx  people is rather not enough
not verified   new york  to london heathrow very good staff very nice comfortable seats seat recline good enough food a bit limited i would recommend ba to others since they are a very good airline
not verified   london to los angeles take off was delayed by  hrs which we spent onboard because of a dent to the door which needed inspection  sure maybe outside of their control i was flying with my wife and two kids    sitting on bulkhead with  seats and using the baby bassinet facility after take off we saw that the inflight entertainment service for the whole section  not whole cabin was not working and we were sitting into an hr overnight flight with two little ones meaning sleeping was not going to happen we contacted the cabin crew who made zero accommodation sorry they said during the flight the cabin crew stood in the galley behind the bulkhead talking loudly while the lights were dimmed and kept slamming drawers as they moved things around to cap it off we landed at pm et and they had left behind our baby car seat and stroller we finally received them back  days later conclusion never fly ba again
not verified   british airways comair johannesburg to cape town route is never less than fully subscribed and on this occasion the equivalent of club europe stretched back  rows service followed the usual pattern of a drink champagne included and comairs idiosyncratic fourcourse meal ie a tiny salad a hot course that one could see before choosing a minute iced cake and a minuscule cheese  biscuits the hot meal is invariably scorched around the edges comair really need to move with the times to a more modern business class offering aside from the meal the flight was typically efficient with arrival slightly ahead of schedule
 trip verified   london to bangkok its not what it used to be but most importantly it does not deliver what it promises any longer  disappointing food outdated and uncomfortable seats appalling baggage handling at lhr and  mediocre crew service onboard the customer service online is just as bad my most recent experience was early january  when they put me next to a couple with a newborn baby in club world on an overnight flight from lhr to bkk baby screams could not sleep and as the cabin was full they could not move me the couple was very nice apologetic and we just had to bear the  hours long haul flight together however my dealings with customer service was appalling when is ba going to offer a kids free zone in club world for people who need to work or sleep
not verified   london to johannesburg departure was slightly delayed by  mph gusts but once away  the flight was the usual comfortable experience on the upper deck seats jk are some of the best as long as the galley is quiet the dinner service was efficient and we were ready for sleep after a film cabin crew were pleasant and attentive toilets were kept clean throughout the flight arrival was  minutes behind time but baggage collection and customs were mercifully quick so we were in the slow lounge just  minutes after landing overall a good flight
 trip verified   overall a very comfortable flight with british airways both of my flights took off on time and reached on time i was really excited to fly ba since they changed the aircraft from boeing  to a boeing  which is known as the queen of the skies  the flight attendants are very nice and professional towards passengers they did their best to speed up the boarding process since both of my flights were full and we took off everything went well on my first flight and also flight time went short over the atlantic due to great tail winds on my second flight to mumbai the flight attendants were polite and respectful and gave the best service however during the lunch service they ran out of vegetarian food option and had to fetch for vegetarian food in other cabins and even give crew meals to passengers who were vegetarian overall my both flights with ba were good there are some shortcomings on their older fleet like lack of usb ports power outlet old ife the ife box in front of you that blocks your legroom  ba  need to refurbish their old cabins on boeing  and boeing if they still plan to use them on longer flights
 trip verified   los angeles to london on th january and my husbands seat was broken the customer service manager was rude to me and made insinuations about our intentions it was a dreadful way to end our honeymoon and left a bitter taste a truly horrendous experience

" trip verified  
fantastic flight travelled solo from london gatwick to glasgow in british airways club europe cabin and could not fault one aspect of the service i arrived at gatwick around  hours prior to departure all ba club world passengers are entitled to fast track security at gatwick this was quick and the staff were pleasant enough the lounge at gatwick was clean and modern and made for a nice relaxing start to the journey boarding was quick and the flight departed ontime and landed  minutes early the crew were very attentive and friendly the inflight meal was delicious i had smoked salmon served with curried rice overall a really lovely flying experience had there been eversoslightly more leg room and inflight entertainment id have given this flight  a fantastic crew who were a credit to the airline"
 trip verified   rio de janeiro to london heathrow love this aircraft only a  class business world traveller plus and economy class  cabins in business class front  rows and rear  rows i had seat a in my opinion the seat window seat with a bit more space than the usual seat at  a little extra helps very private tucked behind second galley area toilet is over the other side jk i settled in to sleep and did not have an evening meal crew very accommodating as they offered water bottles immediately a good few hours sleep as normal and woke up about  minutes before breakfast i really enjoyed the fruit yoghurt muesli and the full english breakfast all in all great service good flight and felt fully relaxed
 trip verified   gatwick to tirana i was incredibly disappointed by the service provided on this flight because it was virtually impossible for me to differentiate what made this flight different from being in economy business class passengers boarded at the same time as economy class passengers there was no curtain dividing economy class from business class and the people in economy class had taken the liberty of removing my cabin bag from my space above my seat to three seats behind me  the seats were the same seats you have in economy the difference being that the middle seat is empty thus creating a divide between window and aisle seats  i encountered odd problems with the meal as well  the lovely cabin crew member notified me that i had no other choice but to eat pasta for dinner because other choices had finished you are better off in economy as you pay less and get the same service flight left on time and landed early british airways have in my opinion the  best inflight wfi service for  pounds you get unlimited very high speed wifi where you can stream youtube videos they offer cheaper packages as well where you can get unlimited texts
not verified  keflavik to london heathrow cabin crew were amazing weather was terrifying as we drove to the airport so we knew things were going to be tough expecting a delay and seeing other european flights were cancelled we expected the same but then were surprised to see our flight boarding snow in blizzard conditions we were surprised but got settled in our seats crew very friendly and a long story short after  hours on the ground waiting for the diicing machine we finally made our way to take off all the staff were so relaxed and calm with all passengers including those who had connecting flights they sat with each one and personally looked at their options the ba online app to help them nonalcoholic drinks and snacks were provided during this time the first officer kept us informed all the time that is was not ba fault that the deicing machine was delayed so much eventually procedures done we were ready for takeoff how the pilot and team managed this in these conditions i will never now but it was a smooth take off an when through the clouds a smooth journey all the way back to heathrow cabin crew provided excellent service being business we were lucky to have champagne and our meals were excellent veg shepherds pie and chicken curry both lovely so just want to thank you ba we know you get a lot of negative reviews but this is to say we cant fault you particularly the crew who made a real effort to talk to all of us well done
not verified   fly economy and youll be paying more for an awful service the london to vancouver route uses old planes the oldest inflight entertainment systems and my food was inedible 
 trip verified  my partner and i spent christmas in tokyo the flight over was enjoyable the staff were polite and helpful and it all ran smoothly our experience back home was completely different the staff were incredibly rude and lazy the flight was  hours and mid flight my partner asked for a bottle of water the lady very rudely said she was going the other way and that my partner could head to the back and help herself my partner headed to the back where there were two more ladies sitting and when requested they pointed to a shelf my partner got the water from both our tvs stopped working mid flight also for a period of  minutes we asked the staff if they could fix the problem the lady said she would try while sighing as  year olds deciding on which airline brands to remain loyal to i can tell you british airways will not be it terrible customer service
 trip verified   london to hong kong at the entrance to the ba business lounge there was a sign saying silver and gold members only my membership had just dropped to bronze while my wifes remained at silver at the reception desk i asked why bronze wasnt allowed and was only told i could enter as a guest of my wifes when i got to the entrance we showed our boarding passes and i can only assume the lady must have overheard our previous conversation as my wife was asked if she was bringing me in as her guest no warm greeting just a jobs worth high handed attitude neither of the ba reps bothered to check my boarding pass properly had they done so they would have seen that it was a business class ticket and i had the right to enter under my own steam anyway fortunately the cabin staff were friendly and much nicer
not verified   los angeles to london heathrow if i could give ba a zero stars i would they have the worst customer service ive flown many airlines around the world with my family but surely we will never fly with british airways again they gave our seats away on the return flight and would not address this after purchasing expensive business class tickets  months in advance to ensure that our family flew  hour flight together the flight to london didnt have the best service most toilets were out of service the beds in business class are the most uncomfortable of all business class ive flown the checkin process at heathrow was disastrous the most inefficient process with no human assistances the limited ones available were all slammed with line of customers i would highly suggest you refrain from using this carrier i wish i would have done a bit of research prior to flying with them
 trip verified   istanbul to london we had to wait for ages to check into our flight after being advised to turn up  hrs before departure time to check in we had to wait for  minutes before any check in staff turned up once they did the staff were surly and rude on the flight and there was no ife no free drink or snack or  a map to track the flight the onboard crew were a bit chaotic serving ms food for purchase the flight was not delayed by too much and relatively smooth however the ba product is now tired and slightly pathetic 
 trip verified   london to bucharest on my flight the hot food finished half way through  i was seated on row  and by the time the food cart reached my row there were no sandwiches left to purchase the fitting of the cabin was horrendous seat change from one row to the other h before take off cost me an additional  gbp 
 trip verified   london heathrow to rio de janeiro not the usual aircraft for this route but it is one of my favourites this aircraft today has a first class but was flown empty as it usually only offers club world flight not full seated in f aisle seat no one in the middle seat so very pleasant it is away from the toilet over at ab but next to galley area which was great as it is a day flight food preordered was very good as usual plenty of drinks offered crew very keen to assist again nothing any trouble at all i did watch some films but i had already been on a previous ba long haul so was not really looking for much i had some rest as it was a long day and i getting a cold arrived late due to a technical problem at heathrow they managed to fix the problem on the taxiway to the runway but after an hour i must say i didnt really need to be told they were trying to fix the problem rather than return to the departure gate all in all another very good flight
 trip verified   london to athens the aircraft and the flight quality were good but they dont provide free food and drink it was unacceptable they did not have sufficient supply for goods they were selling so it ended quickly

 trip verified   hong kong to london i booked a return ticket for my sister though ba provided travel document details they required however when we got to the airport we found out my sisters middle name was not on her ticket and it therefore didnt match her passport name they refused to let her fly after much hassle and my sister getting a temporary visa they enable her to fly however once landing in london i acknowledged that she may have the same problem flying back to taiwan igot in contact with bas executive phone helpline service yet spending a day speaking to them they have only caused me to speak to numerous different people all telling me to do different things we have still not resolved the issue of her ticket not having her middle name on ba are refusing to alter the ticket information to add my sisters middle name onto the ticket they have not been helpful on the phone when i asked them to add her middle name and are not interested in try to solve the issue at hand they were insistent on speaking to my sister who is from taiwan and i told them she is unable to speak english and that i can translate any question for her they did not allow this so she was put on the phone however they only spoke english to her
 trip verified   my husband and i used british airways to fly from london to paris this past august when we arrived at airport we needed to pay for bags was charged  times for one bag after i was assured charges didnt go through have been trying to get a refund from ba since they give you a phone number to call for these claims only to never answer the phone they have you do a claim online only to never respond to your emails i sent them the bank statements and credit card statement showing that i had been charged  times for one bag only  months later did they finally respond to the claim claiming i had two bags and despite the fact that i sent documentation showing  charges and confirmed with bank and credit card that the charges had gone through they only saw two charges and since i had two bags they didnt owe me any money they force you to communicate via email and then dont respond they owe me  usd and refuse to give me my money at this point 
 trip verified   new york to london i was on the last flight out at  pm and this is clearly the cheaper version in all respects  the boeing  certainly showed its age ife screen was tiny seat was well used the flight time was quick  hours and thats about it fa is highly professional to the point of being unfriendly to me the f b was standard and not taken as i had eaten something earlier im a one world emerald and the cabin manager did not greet me its a small touch and in the grand scheme of things means little but is an acknowledgement that you spend time and money with that carrier usually followed by a drink or two 
 trip verified   austin to london along with an  purchase price for each of two roundtrip tickets for my wife and daughter ba charged an additional  for seat reservations to ensure they sat together when they went to check in those seat reservations in both directions had been given away and family had to sit in different seats back home i applied for a refund of the  seat fee and was told there was no proof i paid for them i have credit card charges and email confirmations clearly stating these charges were made but there is no process to upload those documents to ba

 trip verified  london to san francisco this flight was a delight friendly relaxed crew good food and wine and a main deck club world cabin that was nearly empty if you manage your expectations with ba club world and everything goes as it should then you shouldnt be disappointed yes the rollout of the new club world suite has been a long time coming however the food service has improved considerably  ba are trying valiantly to regain their long gone moniker of worlds favourite airline the  has seen better days however given theyre being removed from most airlines passenger services you should take the opportunity to fly one before theyre gone im gradually regaining my confidence in ba
not verified   heathrow to belfast great service in belfast but absolutely shocking in t at heathrow very rude check in staff when told we had to print out boarding passes and also for our suitcases totally disgusted cabin crew were lovely on the  flight to belfast on th december
not verified   london to singapore i was apprehensive about flying ba club world after reading many negative reviews i was however surprised firstly they are not on part with sq or qr  but to be fair i found them to be one of the most reasonably priced offerings you get what you pay for the seat while old is perfectly comfortable with plenty of space the window seats are best for privacy i am tall and had no issues sleeping in fact i slept for almost  hours the service and food out of london was top notch fresh and plentiful which is a welcome contrast to the tiny meals you receive on qantas service was consistent polite and very attentive drinks and water continually topped up i was truly impressed the return flights service was very average and quite sloppy but lets focus on the positives
 trip verified  toulouse to london im a able bodied fit ba customer and silver member and was seated at an emergency exit seat id put away all items and had fastened my seatbelt in full compliance of regultions a cabin crew member came to my row to point out the security exit and safety card and i was listening to him and responding despite this he ordered me to take out my cabin pressure equalizers which he called earplugs i explained to him that i needed to keep them on to protect my ears as the doors were already closed and i can suffer from ear problems when i fly i told him i could hear him perfectly as demonstrated by our vocal exchange despite this he kept talking over me and threatened to remove me from my seat should i fail to follow his order after i begrudgingly took them off he once again ordered me to do it or be removed from my seat and i pointed out i already had i then asked to speak to the purser who came to see me after take off i told him his cabin crew member was unnecessarily rude and needed customer care training or indeed to look for a new job i wrote in to british airways with my complaint but they have not even bothered to respond awful rude airline
 trip verified   london heathrow to stockholm business class shorthaul is what it is seats are the same as in economy but with no one sitting in the middle seat but you get served drinks and food proper gin for the gt and good food
 trip verified   johannesburg to london we had limited recline seats on an  hour overnight flight at checked in we asked and were told we had good seats completed a complaint and asked why ba thought this was ok how come their representatives are allowed to lie never flying ba again
 trip verified   johannesburg to london the recently refurbished first and club world lounge at jnb has failed to resolve the congestion when passengers from the two evening flights to lhr descend on it theres more table space for eating and the food has improved but poor acoustics mean intrusion on privacy crying babies and facetime calls add to the restless maelstrom of human activity boarding was reasonably quick although there was the usual confusion about group queues the predominantly young mixed fleet crew were competent but lacked finesse and kept on getting drinks orders muddled the meal service took ages because of some unidentified problem with heating the main course the food itself wasnt at all bad  when it was finally served the cabin temperature wasnt too hot and we both slept quite well arrival was ten minutes ahead of schedule and baggage collection was quick overall a good flight despite the aged club world product
 trip verified   london heathrow to miami flying the boeing  unfortunately ba hasnt done much work on their first class on these aircraft seats are flat bed but you have that wedge in the front that even for my  makes the beds small and since its so narrow your feet get clamped if you sleep on your side these seats are business class on for example qatar airways and i still think a first class ticket should include wifi but as always the service excel and the crew are so friendly and helpful meals are impeccable
 trip verified   stockholm to london heathrow as always ba works excellent with service on the ground and in the air they still have a good gin aboard for a decent gt and even if the meals in business looks like the came from the s economy they taste great
not verified  london to sydney via singapore flight left on time cabin crew where fantastic meals were great leaving london we had a chicken stir fry and landing into singapore at  we were served an english breakfast which i can eat any time of day but wife thought it was a bit odd at singapore all passengers had to disembark the aircraft while it was refuelled and clean when reboarding you had to go through a security check at the gate we were on the ground in singapore for hour min nd leg to sydney was great also food and drink service was great again  hours long haul flight was comfortable we had exit row seating for entire flight which i recommend to anyone over ft tall
 trip verified  london to new york jfk we were booked on brussels airlines two of us which cancelled the flight and rerouted us on ba the flight bru to london was fine but the transatlantic leg and heathrow airport terminal  were utter nightmares never again will i go to or through heathrow however this review is about bas  to jfk an aircraft that was in such a sorry state that it should have been junked years ago how does ba have the gall to call its service business class the seats were tiny and wrapped in plastic chicken coop partitions that rattled and even fell down on several occasions let me add that we faced backwards and looked at a filthy wall cabin service was friendly and the food was actually quite decent aside from that i now understand why ba has such a horrendous and welldeserved reputation never again
 trip verified   the first thing is the shortage of staff the business cabin is quite large and eight across and seem to be serviced by one or two people each side it meant that the drink after takeoff did not appear for an hour after the order was taken unfortunately although they were pleasant the staff were not up to the mark and appeared very undertrained i asked a young man to turn on the reading light and he claimed there werent any i showed him the one by my seat and after fiddling with it he said it must be broken at the end of the flight i discovered the switch despite being a newly configured plane the dividing screen kept dropping i had to ask for a cup of tea  times there was only a choice of two reds and two white wines and considering the number of people in the business section i cannot understand why they  would not offer a third there was port on the menu but was never offered with cheese every time the next course came out the setting was not ready to accept it due to plates and glasses from previous course many people had clutter uncleared for an hour after end of meal most of the courses were quite small portions and by the end of the meal i was ready for a mini snack i am not a big eater but i was peckish the layout of the business cabin is cramped i am  and i could not stretch out the seats and legroom are extremely narrow and people in the centre two rows and the window seats have to climb over other passengers this means no one has a easy seat you either have to climb or be climbed over i wonder how they can expect such a bad design to be accepted in the business market i travel on many airlines in business and ba is still the bottom of the pile and reluctantly the last one i would use the centre and window seats have their food and drinks served effectively through the service hatch across other customers unfortunately upon arrival at bridgetown the ba team didnt get any better after one hour  minutes of waiting for my fast tracked luggage i approached a guy wearing a ba tabard and he just shrugged his shoulders i then found another guy who worked for the ground staff and he went outside and found about  cases sitting by the tarmac doing nothing 
 trip verified   brussels to bangkok via london club world from london to bangkok on  nov  seats c and d it was a boeing  with a  seat configuration in the business cabin which gives the cabin a crowded impression the seats are comfortable with a flat bed mattress good selection of entertainment although a rather small screen the food menu offers different choices of starters main course and desserts the food was disappointing i had smoked salmon as a starter and british beef as main course my soup was cold mybeef was overcooked and quantity was economy classlike the service is very friendly but not personal im used to be adressed by my name when i fly business class  while serving the meals they forget serving me wine the amount of cabin crew is not enough for a crowded business class cabin after dinner i went to sleep the seat is turned into a real bed with an extra mattress and a good pillow the space is narrow it is difficult to make the bed once the bed is made there is no place to put  personal stuff i had a real good night of sleep though if your seat is not at the aisle you have to step over someones legs to go to the toilet the toilets are small and simple not cleaned frequently enough when i woke up breakfast service was running  the breakfast is good  yoghurt pastries fresh fruit and a full english breakfast overall british airways world club is a rather standard business class lacks personalized attention and lacks the feel good experience  if ba wants to compete they have a long way to go i hope they can make it up a bit on our return flight
 trip verified   san francisco to oslo via london the head support was damaged so i had to sit  hours leaned forward the flight from san francisco was delayed so i missed my connecting flight in london to oslo i came first to the ba counter but received a new flight  hours  minutes later rude staff gave me a voucher for  gbp 
 trip verified   i had a connection flight from london to berlin traveling with hand luggage i got through a automatic boarding gate and the man at the gate said that i need to check my baggage  he has no right to grab my passport and boarding pass if the flight is full they should check overhead lockers if there arent any things which should be put under seats and where can fits more hand luggage the flight arrived in berlin  minutes late
not verified   london to johannesburg with british airways bas b gates lounge is a rather more civilised place to pass time than the galleries lounges in the main terminal its also a tad closer on the transit  or via the rather useful walkway on level   to the c gates where the as depart from the new boarding by groups meant snaking queues but at least group  moved fairly speedily the club world were still the same much maligned seats with the small unresponsive ife screens and limited selection of films the dinner service was slow because of the unwise introduction of individual trays brought to each seat trolleys may lack glamour but one does get off to sleep quicker on an overnight flight breakfast was adequate but nothing more landing was exactly on time overall a reasonable flight but the inflight service was distinctly average
 trip verified   london to bangalore the flight from bangalore to london on  november  was delayed by  hours that resulted in me missing the connection flight my return from london to bangalore was initially delayed by  hrs we were assigned a boarding gate and after waiting at the gate for  mins announcement was made the flight was delayed hrs mins due to maintenance 
not verified  london to sydney via singapore i would like to express my thanks and appreciation to the staff at the bag drop centre at heathrow when i lost my passport on thursday evening st november they spent nearly  hours trying to locate it and it was eventually found  mins before my flight was due to leave a big thank you to you all i would also like to thank the cabin crew on flight basingapore to sydney  november who were so kind after i was taken ill during the flight i was looked after so well
 trip verified   lisbon to london i pay extra to check my bag to ensure i am not using more than my share of overhead space to have british airways charge me  euros to check a bag to my final destination and then insist that my briefcase be put under the seat in a cramped aircraft to ensure there is room in the overhead bin for travelers too cheap to check their bags is an insult will never fly ba again
not verified   ba operate daily shuttles from london to glasgow its a busy route and im sure make money plus there is no competition however ba flights are rarely on time and the fee paying passengers are fed stories about the aircraft was delayed enroute from some far flung exotic location because i have several buses and trains to catch after i reach glasgow punctuality means a lot to me and not a lot to ba hence im very disappointed with the service they provide
 trip verified   doha to london surprisingly good flight ontime departure and early arrival by min very very attentive and friendly crew especially towards children food was halal since from doha clearly announced to passengers bag arrival was ok seat leg room and entertainment beyond my expectation
 trip verified   london to buenos aires we paid extra on top of our holiday cost to fly with them as it was a direct flight firstly they cancelled our flight a few months before departure meaning we had to go a day earlier and pay an extra night in a hotel the plane was old and cramped making it difficult to get up and walk around during the  hour flight the entertainment system was pathetic not much film choice a random selection of tv programmes and no games the drinks service was lacking my food was awful and there were no snacks offered in between on other long haul flights we have had comfort packs with toothbrushtoothpaste etc no such offerings
 trip verified   san francisco to london a is a wonderful aeroplane movie selection was below average staff were polite fist time i used the call button midflight response was fast but on second occasion i was repeatedly ignored call button for  minutes i dont see how that is acceptable
 trip verified  sydney to singapore with british airways packed in like sardines in a tin can what a disappointment of an airline they pack you in and even getting to your seat is a debacle due to the cramped nature of the flight configuration you awkwardly stare at your fellow guests who sit right opposite you trying not to lock gaze my seat was so close to the aisle that at times it felt like people were walking over me to get past very narrow passage ways would not and could not recommended this airline these seats are at best premium economy
 trip verified  london to mauritius we are fortunate enough to have flown with many different airlines including low cost carriers and also upper class cabins on other premium airlines without a shadow of a doubt the whole british airways experience is the poorest of them all both with the aeroplanes and seats the general service and experience but more importantly the poor customer service following the bad flight i truly feel that this airline deserves to go bust because of the truly disgraceful approach to service and the product they deliver i begrudge flying with them and given the option i always choose a different airline
 trip verified   los angeles to amsterdam via london due to delayed take off i risked missing my connecting flight thanks to the excellent premium host service julie and her colleague i managed to be on time thank you very much
 trip verified   london to vancouver i used to fly this aircraft and route for many years until it was no longer priced competitively i flew on the th and it was a remarkably bad experience food service was very poor in most aspects i had the chicken tandoori which was far too spicy for most palettes no drink was offered with the meal which was astonishing rather tea and coffee an obviously far cheaper offering was supplied soon after the dinner tray was handed i had to ask twice for a beer before it was deliveredthis then put me out of sync with the service the one time yes one time offer of tea and coffee was then obviously missed by me completely service itself was not good with no warmth or hospitality on a hr flight engagement is pretty critical our hostesshost seemed to be only interested in those sitting in the extra legroom seats and essentially ignored everyone else the cold snack was a cold tasteless sandwich just prior to landing the entertainment system is a joke as it is so old i had become so accustomed to a normalnewish tv screen that i was blown away that this system was still in place the screen size was the equivalent of your phones no music selection worth talking about so i just used my ipad on this or similar routes i have flown air canada westjet virgin atlantic air transat ba was by far the worst and some of those airlines are budget in nature and offer paid meals only i cannot believe that the mighty ba offers such a terrible product in  i will spend more to fly better and actively avoid ba on long haul
 trip verified  the flight departure was delayed due to what the captain described in his announcement as a mix up with paperwork disembarkation was delayed due to what he also described as a mix up with landing bridge allocation so the plane had to taxi around the runway until a gate was found we missed our connecting flight the staff in purple at the airport who are supposed to help passengers find connecting flights didnt know what to do we ended up being shunted onto another flight resulting in a four hour delay all of this inconvenience is due to bas incompetent management my seat would not recline and the food was just carbohydrate filigree the flight attendants are rude it used to be a good airline
 trip verified  london heathrow to lisbon mediocre the flight was very smooth and arrived on time cabin service left a great deal to be desired and staff seemed to be just going through the motions no bread roll was offered during meal service and despite requesting a glass of wine to accompany the meal this was not forthcoming and staff required a nudge before it was delivered not a great club europe experience
not verified  london to boston comfortable flight in economy class food was fairly good both ways  dinner for the evening flight west and the returning night flight east got some solid sleep in on the flight back
 trip verified  tirana to london gatwick i fly british airways around six times a month thanks to my work and while i almost always have a pleasant experience this past flight definitely outdid all the others we boarded and departed exactly on time with a very friendly and welcoming crew while the flight was fully booked my travel companion and i were lucky that no one was sitting on our row so that we could have an empty middle seat and therefore more space the best surprise of this flight by far was the availability of wifi which i have never had on any other british airways flight within europe in fact the wifi package i got which included only texting was unlimited and incredibly fast  as good as my home connection this truly made this flight more enjoyable as it allowed me to continue my business even during the flight which is extremely valuable to me something that british airways can improve on would be leg space which in this flight i noticed was particularly tight although that is a common problem for me as i am  cm tall also for unknown reasons no food or snacks were served on this  hours  minute flight only drinks this was a slight struggle as i had skipped breakfast but i managed well the flight however arrived ahead of schedule and we deboarded quickly i always recommend ba  and will continue to do so

 trip verified   london to san francisco return in economy the seats are small outbound was bearable because there was an empty seat between the two of us but returning no empty seat and it was horrible im only  and female but couldnt lean down to the seat in front of me to collect my belongings if you want to get anything from your bag below the seat in front of you you will need to do some major maneuvering touching the person next to you throughout the flight is unavoidable i flew on a  both ways they no longer have any air vents you can adjust so both flights got stuffy and warm i had to ask them to turn up the ac both ways i was literally sweating economy is small with the aircraft mostly made up of business class asian vegetarian meal was good as usual although the breakfast was terrible asian vegetarian breakfast in economy plus is much better i will find an alternative airline for my long haul flights its not worth it
not verified   gatwick to venice we have flown this route and class on two occasions and been pleased with all aspects on the recent trip we both had mobility issues and the check in operator immediately suggested their assistance service it was welcome and efficient particularly as the gate was a very distant one the flight departed to time the cabin staff were pleasant the food was good in flight information from the flight deck was good the landings were noticeably smooth the return journey was similarly good i was very satisfied

 trip verified  london to belfast british airways bullied my parents and spoilt a special occasion i booked my parents on ba to attend my investiture at the palace my mother had a heart attack  months ago and this was her first flight post recovery and i had chosen ba expecting the best level of service instead they were treated appallingly and felt bullied by the airline staff my mother suffers from claustrophobia and always requests an aisle seat and i booked my parents on  aisle seats side by side i printed their boarding passes out myself with seats c and d on arrival at checkin one of the boarding passes was not recognised by the scanner so assistance printed out a new one on going through security the boarding pass was again not recognised and a new pass was printed once my parents arrived at the gate they noticed that one of the seats had been changed my father explained the situation but the rep at checkin started quoting the geneva convention that ba are only contracted to get them from a to b and could change seats if they wanted waiting at the gate to try and resolve the situation and eventually with  minutes before airborne they were rushed into the aircraft and forced to sit apart with no care for their welfare or circumstances at no stage did they receive any apologetic words for someone recovering from a heart attack this was an unnecessary stressful event and spoilt what had been a special family occasion i have been holding on with the hope that bas slide from grace will halt but seem to be constantly disappointed i will await bas response to my parents i know they will not fly the carrier again but i will be handing back my ba amex and all points if an appropriate apology is not issued will update in summary dont trust ba with your loved ones care
 trip verified   london to cape town we had booked business class tickets a year in advance for a trip to africa i usually fly star alliance but picked ba for a segment for better connection timing through london to cape town this was a huge mistake i had tried to reserve seats on ba website twice and was not able to do so then i tried to call ba twice and gave up after being on hold for an hour each time with no call back option when we arrived today in london from toronto at the connections desk seven hours before our flight we were told that business class was oversold and we would be downgraded to premium economy bas representative told us that because we did not have reserved seats we were at the bottom of the list for business class and that loyalty customers would all have priority for seats over us but we would still be welcome in the lounge as if this was a bonus then there was a problem for us to clear security to get to the lounge since they could not print our boarding passes due to the down grade it took close to an hour to get settled into the lounge from the time we first arrived at the connecting desk we asked to speak to a manager but at each of our four interactions with ba staff we were told that they would get some to speak with us giving the impression that they were trying to pass off unhappy customers as fast as they could at one point i got visibly frustrated after the ba staff issuing our new boarding passes indicated that our down grade was voluntary which it definitely was not after two and a half hours ba customer service managers came to speak with us they were the first ones who were actually apologetic and tried to address the situation from a customer oriented perspective if british airways think giving bulkhead seats in premium economy and basic lounge access to paying business class passengers is adequate customer service for a downgrade from a paid business fare on our upcoming overnight flight i will not be booking flights on ba again
 trip verified   san jose to london the tv screen of f was broken could not be locked into position that would allow to watch movies flight attendants could not fix it and suggested to move to a different seat which we slipped on purpose while checked in the back of the seat in front was dirty the tray on the d where i was moved to had a hole on the right side and the tv screen was not sensitive enough to be be operated by touch although my husband in e and me turned in the breakfast cards together the flight attendant insisted they dont have it and was not planning to wake him up and serve him breakfast  flight attendants were doing their best but it seems that they were understaffed
 trip verified  london heathrow to edinburgh boarding efficient flight was full so passengers asked to volunteer to check in hand luggage by doing so they would get priority boarding i took up the offer too out my laptop and carried it on to the plane the aircraft is only two months old and i was sat at the back of the plane   f i am sure ryanair have more room british airways on this aircraft are offering an ultra low cost service under a cloak of legacy carrier legitimacy
 trip verified   flight from gatwick to barbados check in and business lounge were good it looks like they had added champagne to the self service drinks which is a positive breakfast was good flight left on time boarding well run i have not flown in their economy cabin for a while and it seems ok new configuration but that does come with panasonic ife system which is way better than the old rockwell collins systems food was fine and service friendly
 trip verified   we were not supposed to be on this flight but had been bumped from our icelandair flight and rebooked onto ba direct from toronto to london heathrow we tried to get it changed as we were supposed to fly into gatwick the flight was quite good service was fantastic and the chicken tikka masala was tasty the crew onboard was friendly flight was on time and landing was amazingly smooth
 trip verified   i was travelling from jeddah to london with a bag i arrive  hour  minutes earlier but the check in counter was closed i tried my best but there was no staff to help me so i have to leave my bag as i was not allowed to take the bag on the plane in london i made a complaint but they were saying that we cant do any thing and to get through to customer service the phone call takes about  hour and  minutes of wait
not verified   zurich to london return both legs travelled with hand luggage only and i could not choose a seat without paying fair enough but when there are  empty rows either side of  strangers cramped into one row and not allowed spread out as they had not paid the premium price seems mean to say the least hand luggage fares are last to board make them uncomfortable on board no free food nor drink
 trip verified   san francisco to london efficient check in by friendly agent who offered an upgrade to first at  per person which we declined refurbished lounge was spacious and comfortable with nice selection of snacks boarding on time but could have been better controlled flight left and landed ahead of schedule flight attendants were excellent and the food is vastly improved compared to our last trip business class is not cheap but we had an excellent flight with no complaints

 trip verified   vancouver to london very poor experience my flight with ba the  business is not nice as much as crowded as economical class one toilet closed nobody around to repair  on one point ba even better than asian companies its even more freezing why do we need to freeze in such a  hours trip  no staff to answer my question no staff to make it better one good point the seat are surprisingly comfortable but easy to make it better
 trip verified  london to malaga a terminally ill airline packed with clueless staff full of attitude at the checking at gatwick airport i was told the flight might well be delayed of h as not departed yet from malaga sms confirmed the delay without a new time of departure and provided a link for flight status at gatwick there are no arrivaldeparture boards prior to security for me to check if the flight was on time as shown online when asked the ba guy at the lounge kiosk he said i could check the link provided or go through security where monitors are surprisingly the flight was on time and no text was sent for an update at the gate we were told the aircraft was replaced no apologies from anyone neither ground nor on the flight we boarded at  pm and took off at  stiff and no recliner seats cabin crew are so sociopathic and full of attitudes  additional seats are replacing the  toilets located at the back of the  and located at the very far end of the aircraft in the cabin crew storage room and working space is horrible low cost service for a flag carrier ticket price
 trip verified   brussels to london we were not given a seat number upon check in and were left waiting outside the gate for the boarding passes to be re printed without any explanation everyone else with a boarding pass was boarding whilst about  were just looking at the operators thinking what is going on extremely poor communication from the airline to and from the airport operators 
 trip verified   my flight from london to singapore in premium economy was the worst i have experienced the seat was uncomfortable the flight tracker failed after two hours the breakfast prior to arrival in singapore scrambled egg was like rubber they ran out of cups and so my wife and i had no coffee tea or drink with our breakfast i used the call button to get some attention and no one came to answer my call even after waiting more than  minutes eventually i made contact with a passing cabin crew member and advised that we had not had a drink and was told that they would come back i never saw the crew member again 
 trip verified   kuala lumpur to glasgow via london the service started first some drinks on my aisle was a female attendant and a young male attendant  i asked for an ale the attendant pretended not to understand what i was asking for i repeated many times the word ale with my spanish accent but she still did not catch it the male attendant said like an ipa i answered yes  i changed to a beer and she offered me amstel or heineken i chose amstel and had to ask for ice  to make it drinkable when the service was finished the female attendant collected the empty bottles and cans and glasses but skipped me for the meal i chose the beef and asked for a beer the male attendant realized that the empty can was still there took it with the food on my and no drinks i started to eat after ten minutes it was obvious that the beer was not coming so i stopped another attendant going to business class and he came back with an option of tiger or heineken lager the female attendant offered me coffee but she did not mention it was normal coffee and in the menu it said that decaf was available if you specifically request that abreakfast i was offered tea or coffee even decaf i accepted but there was no milk or cream for me
 trip verified  london heathrow to seychelles really great flight boarding was very quick the flight was full seats great  ab good inflight entertainment plenty of choices food was good as we already preordered our meals my beef was well done just how i like it after a late  minute delay we landed on time into seychelles the crew were very attentive lots of very demanding passengers all in all a good flight after  hours of sleep
 trip verified   edinburgh to london heathrow i have no problems with any of the flight crew or service while flying everything on the plane was fine after the flight landed i rushed to the baggage claim because my wife and i had another flight out of london and only had an hour to make it even though we could see the plane and watch the baggage crew drive the bags over it took  minutes before my bag came through the baggage claim service desk turned away  other furious customers until a manager could arrive by which time i was running to catch my next flight on a different airline which i missed turns out the next flight home on our next airline wasnt for another  days hoping that british airways would help us in some way we went to their horrendous customer service desk where an agent basically told us to pound sand it ended up costing my wife and i almost  for new tickets to get home spent the next  hours in the airport and british airways refused to offer us as a meal voucher we will never use this airline again
not verified  amman to london this is a nice aircraft with comfortable seats and a very soft landing this aircraft flies from amman airport at  am local time and arrives in only  hours to london this is a very good product
 trip verified  london to athens british airways is a glorified budget airline a hour flight and back to athens and no food or drinks provided ask for a cup of water and they charge you a ridiculous price an ms inflated price sandwich is the meal no entertainment options either no usb charging on the seat as well any reputable airline for a flight of this length provides this options in  yet they charged fullservice airline prices so there is a mismatch flew aegean on the same route and a full meal and drinks are provided
not verified   terrible lack of any leg and body room in economy this was easily the most cramped space i have ever flown and i travel a lot the flight was  hours of leg cramps and pain with no room for any modicum of comfort the little amount of space in economy cabin is disgusting if the seat in front of you reclines as they invariably do there is even less room shameful the food was below average as well even for bottom of the barrel budget airplane food i will never fly british airways again  stars beware i should only add that the nyc jfk and london waiting areas do not have near enough seats requiring many to stand or sit on the floor and the call to plane was disorganized bedlam horrible excuse for an airline
 trip verified   buenos aires to london heathrow rwturn the aircraft is very old cabin configuration is very old and tired ife screens have not been changed since they were first installed my ipod has a larger and more responsive screen before taking off in buenos aires some pax but not all were offered water or orange juice i never got any after take off drinks were offered followed by a hot meal food choices ran out in the first row seats were uncomfortable footrests were jammed on the return flight sparkling wine and water were offered before take off followed by drinks and the meal i had chosen online was a beef stew with mashed potatoes poor movie choices miniature screen and uncomfortable seats crew ok no indication as to which toilets to use either forward in business class or rear economy having flown norwegian on their b in their premium cabin on the same route ba is a waste of my money 
 trip verified  mexico city to barcelona via london heathrow the b is an incredible plane the legroom is quite good the seat is comfortable and the ife has a great number of movies series and music the food is average the first meal was meat with mashed potatoes salad and wine not very tasty the breakfast was scrambled eggs with mushrooms fruit and a muffin it was delicious the cabin crew was ok not bad not excellent we arrived on time and was a great flight on the second flight the cabin crew appeared twice no ife no onboard service its almost like a low cost i recommend for long flights but not for european flights
 trip verified  great all round ba  october good price easy boarding lovely cabin crew great iced coffee on sale comfortable on time and a nice smile from the cabin and flight crew after a windy landing couldnt ask for more until they reinstate a free drink and sandwich
 trip verified  flew back from abu dhabi in world traveller plus the seat is so uncomfortable it does not warrant the price tag of the seat seat cushioning terrible and zero feeling of comfort i got no sleep a snack was served after take off which was quite tasty but breakfast was just dismal tasteless not much interaction with the crew but they seemed friendly enough would not travel with british airways in this cabin again really not worth the price tag
not verified  flew from london heathrow to abu dhabi honestly they were really good legroom great crew excellent  looked after us superbly food and drinks were bang on did vegas in april too nowt wrong with this airline
 trip verified   johannesburg to amsterdam via london after many delayed departures they announced that the flight was cancelled and rescheduled to depart the following night at pm the following night at  pm they announced further delays due to the same technical fault reported  hours previously finally departed at pm consequences were missed connecting flight to amsterdam we also had to pay for our no show at our hotel in amsterdam and when trying to claim this charge from ba they declined but offered to pay for our taxi arrived in amsterdam  hours later what really annoyed us was the lack of communication and disorganized manner on how the events were mishandled once on board the crew were really nice and just as we were getting new hope this was shattered by the terrible food and on board entertainment that was outdated our connecting ba flight back home was the same thing and on arrival we were delayed on disembarking
 trip verified  dubai to london heathrow i flew on the a on one of its first trips and will be flying it again on the same multi segment trip i tried sq business class and ek business class and sadly the old ba business class on an aging b on overnight trips the new business suite offering from ba is the best business class i have experienced i am a ba gold card holder and the experience was outstanding the first lounge at dxb was very good with plenty of seating and a good choice of drinks food choice in the lounge was limited but not an issue on board the new suite was very comfortable and i had a great nights sleep with the closed door making all the difference to getting a full six hours in the bed was very comfortable food choices were very limited soup and sandwiches although this did suit the timing of the flight i would say this is an excellent very serious business product for night time business travellers whether it works for leisure travellers who want to wow rather than sleep or daytime travellers i dont know but i certainly could work very effectively in my suite downside is the ife is still rubbish in relation to the rest of the product
 trip verified  istanbul to new york via london literally the worst experience we have tried this airline for the first and definitely last time they should go through their customer service hiring department from scratch
 trip verified   yesterday my husband and i decided to to come home from rome earlier than the scheduled time at pm when i rang ba in london the customer service adviser was helpful and reassuring and able to change the the flight time to pm without having to pay extra onboard the flight the steward gave me hot water and milk so that i can used my own preferred decaf tea and did not charge me while waiting to get off the plane i had a wonderful conversation with the ba staff who are so pleasant i love flying with ba and we will continue to do so we have booked our flight with ba next year thank you for taking good care of us and just to sat how much we appreciate your excellent service
 trip verified  flight from london to athens with british airways was one of the worst experiences the new slim seats are so uncomfortable you spend the flight and sadly the next day as well in pain the screens with flight info have gone no frills and airline has become a bad quality budget airline sad avoid
not verified   short  minute flight north and south with british airways lounge at lhr and also ncl was busy but there was no shortage of seats gates for departures and arrivals were very conveniently placed near the airport exits the seats on the flight were comfortable and the schedule was perfectly on time
not verified   calgary to gothenburg via london with british airways staff are very friendly and helpful entertainment was good food was just ok although a salmon sandwich as a snack on a full plane wouldnt be my first choice to serve the seats are incredibly uncomfortable super narrow to the point that you sit with your arms crossed so as to not hit your neighbours for a  hour flight this is painful paid for the extra leg room which was good but still one of the most uncomfortable long flights have ever been on recommend for short trips
 trip verified   for a long time i have avoided taking british airways due to its poor past reputation yesterday i traveled on ba  from kuala lumpur to london heathrow i boarded the flight with an open mind over  hours later i disembarked feeling very happy because it is always good to see an airline make visible improvements that deliver value to its customers a praise is due and i want to congratulate ba for such a pleasant experience the flight departed on time and arrived half an hour early the crew was not only professional but they did everything with a smile that made passengers feel welcomed the plane was pristine new with delightful entertainment content the food was way above the expectations of a seasoned economy class traveler what more can i say enough to say that i will be traveling with ba again
 trip verified   austin to london another pleasant flight on an ageing  after the horror of discovering one of us was allocated a centre seat meaning effectively sleeping next to a stranger she kindly swapped seats so we could be together for a couple the centre seats are really quite nice and you feel youre in your own little world a good flight on time with a nice crew is as good as you can expect
 trip verified   london to kuala lumpur better than i was expecting after reading the other reviews the seats are great and service was very friendly on this leg less so on the return a few areas need improvement  separate toilets from economy  dedicated crew for the premium economy section rather than added onto their economy service  a better nd meal  the main meal was great and noticeably more premium however the next meal breakfast was a bit of an afterthought would i choose ba premium eco again  yes definitely
not verified  i wish i could give a zero i was booked on a flight from newark to madrid via london i come to find that the minimum layover time in london is  hr my flight layover in london was hrmin british airways promised that the arriving and departing terminals in london were the same but that was a total lie my wife and i were sprinting across the airport but between getting off the aeroplane having to go through security again and having to get to the other side of the airport for our connection we missed the layover flight we had the same route in the reverse direction i called ba hoping to change the return flights and explained this situation they kept insisting that since the layover was a staggering  minutes more than londons minimum hr layover threshold that they were unable to help in any way british airways has by far the worst customer service i have ever experienced ryanair which is a nofrills airline has better customer service and that is saying something i will never be flying ba again and plan on converting my company away from ba flights as well be warned stay away from this carrier at all costs or be prepared to deal with zero customer service in case any issues arise
not verified   one of the reasons we traveled club class was because ba have lounges where you can get away from the usual airport chaos and screaming children ba dont tell you there is no lounge at kos airport limited seating very noisy limited facilities not sure i will spend so much on air tickets with them in the future if they dont warn of limited facilities it doesnt help that the flight is delayed by an hour
not verified   gatwick to alicante on my outbound flight  sept i gave ba almost  out of  across the board in a review they invited me to complete on my return flight  sept it was a different matter from entering alicante airport up until boarding the service was by comparison below standard except the vip lounge which was good travelling club europe had no advantages only one check in open for all passengers no bag drop facilities no facility to print boarding passes when invited to board we had to wait  minutes on the ramp before being let on the plane the iberia factor honestly you wouldnt have thought it was the same company once on the plane everything went like clockwork
 trip verified   vancouver to london great flight on the superb a in my opinion the most comfortable and quiet aircraft flying at the moment outstanding in flight service from the crew attentive polite and professional the very best of british airways service food well above average for this cabin  though breakfast could have been better ife excellent the seat is comfortable with a good recline and supplied with a decent plump cushion and an excellent quilted blanket very enjoyable flight highly recommended
 trip verified   gatwick to alicante  hours  hour sitting on tarmac with my knees rammed against seat in front no room to move i have travelled on several airlines on this route in last  months  vueling airlines has best seats stay away from the rest unless you are under ft tall
not verified  we have had some torrid experiences with ba  which we have not been shy to report so when we flew yesterday with them from heathrow to austin and had a great flight in every way it felt right to feedback on that the staff in the upstairs business class cabin were frankly wonderful cheerful efficient and calm what more could you ask the food was pretty nice and the champagne lovely the beds were very comfortable and sleeping was easy i literally cannot think of any real negatives the luggage lockers were quite small but then its an older model of the plane so that probably explains it if only ba could deliver this kind of experience on every occasion they would once again be the worlds favourite airline sadly the current ceo doesnt seem able to inspire and motivate his staff to be consistently delightful perhaps once he moves on we can expect something better although the flight was a bit delayed on departure it arrives bang on time as we entered the literally empty immigration area we were met by the most charming customs officer you can imagine who ended up giving us tourist tips and ideas for bars surreal as anyone who regularly travels to the states will testify it felt as if we were living in the truman show at one point but in the nicest possible way get yourselves down to good ole austin now that ba fly there direct fantastic
 trip verified  london heathrow to austin with british airways it was a little bit like going back in time to fly upper deck on a  to austin but it was the most enjoyable flight weve taken for a long time it was so quiet on our deck and we had a fantastic flight crew who couldnt do enough for you and always with a smile we arrived as fresh as you can from  hours in the air on time and thoroughly enjoyed the experience the only slight issue was the very ife systems and small overhead lockers but plenty of spare lockers and our ipads took are of that
not verified   i did not actually fly because of their pilot strike this review is because of the poor service to its customers who were due to fly on the days of the strike i immediately tried to rebook with the only other airline that flew to jersey but of course they had put their air fares up for the day in question and had to pay  more for a return flight i then cancelled my ba flight but they only refunded  of the  i had paid the  difference was picking my seats how do they consider that not part of the cost of the flight they should have refunded me everything as it was not my fault they were striking i completed their complaint form a month ago and they have never responded to me  weeks ago i phoned their customer service line and the person i spoke to said he would refund me the  i never received the refund 
 trip verified  the start of our journey back from from efl was inauspicious with hundreds of delayed and stranded passengers crammed into the departure lounge awaiting flights on airlines other than ba as it was weather in the uk plus air traffic control issues meant that departure was delayed by  minutes once airborne in a refitted a complete with a nice fresh leather smell cabin crew in ce were friendly and efficient and the food including a cod dish was quite reasonable it was interesting to note that the refit hadnt extended to the toilet which was looking distinctly worse for the wear a big plus on the flight  and a first for me  was wifi which actually worked and was quite fast  although at a cost of  for an hours use i thought it was meant to be free for business class passengers but evidently not landing made up for some time but we were parked right in the middle of nowhere because of a backlog of flights however ba had laid on a separate bus for ce passengers and we were out of the airport  minutes later so not too bad all in all
not verified  chicago to zurich via london delays after delays the flight was supposed to depart at  pm chicago time but was scheduled at  pm we waited a long time at the airport finally at  pm we managed to board on the a for my first time but the legroom was horrible the ife completely unfunctional and with no food served during the taxi a technical problem occurred and we returned to the gate in the end the plane took off at  am chicago time and we arrived in london heathrow at  pm we had to wait  hours for boarding for another  minutes delayed flight we arrived in zurich on an old a at  pm zurich time instead of the original  pm very stressful at least the staff were nice
 trip verified  glasgow to london smooth flight departurearrival on time boarding was quick the seat was ok although i had preordered a vegetarian option the caterer hadnt provided any so they said  but the flight attendant quickly solved the issue the food was good and the wine french bourgogne also surprisingly good flight attendant was professional polite and attentive to detail all in all a great flight
 trip verified  having booked this flight a week before the ba strike and mistakingly thinking that the strike would have ended two days before i flew and not in fact the day before i was apprehensive as to how it would operate the checkin and security clearance at t took only  minutes personally i do not like the self service bag and tag drop that ba operate as one is not  confident that i did everything correctly boarding is by the new fare group system  to  which depends on how much one has paid for the ticket again im not a fan of this possibly due to the previous days strike and the need to accommodate passengers from canceled flights the aircraft was a large a boarding was however smooth on board the virtually full cabin was very clean and the eurotraveller seats were comfortable and offer sufficient leg room im mcm and my knees do not touch the seat in front the departure was only  minutes behind the scheduled departure time in flight there were  cabin staff in the euro traveller cabin believe  in club cabin who were very efficient and friendly and so one only had to wait no more than  minutes from take off to purchase refreshments on such a full flight again it is a shame though that ba have gone down the no frills line and charge for food and drinks when they describe themselves as a full service airline the landing at tegel was  minutes ahead of schedule all in all it was a pleasant flight and the value was very good as it was combined with a hotel booking tegel itself is a bit of hassle with only  border police carrying out immigration controls for over  passengers at the end of the airbridge and a further  minute wait for luggage but this was not bas fault
 trip verified   i wouldnt even rate them   x business class passengers booked via on business  bag lost in transit ground crew in mxp rude dismissive  most unhelpful unable to locate missing bag waited for next flight to arrive still no bag decided to cut short our trip as the bag contained essential meds  ok thats a lesson learnt the hard way due to this being an ob booking ba customer services unwilling to be flexible and change tickets resulting in full fare tickets purchased to return apparently the bag arrived hrs later we were back in the uk despite ba website showing in transit lhrmxp for  days numerous lengthy calls to customer service proved fruitless passed from one department to another then cut off after an email to their ceo  director of brand and customer experience received a call from global engagement executive team offering  evoucher abysmal customer services no wonder their reputation is in tatters i will never fly ba again
 trip verified  flying london city to geneva the only plus was the embraer e jet had a comfortable interior with plenty of leg room for an economy seat other than that ba now offers a basic no frills service that is no different to a budget airline yet it charges full service prices
 trip verified   los angeles to istanbul via london flight between london and istanbul is like coach no tv and small leg room transatlantic business seats are very narrow and mine did not become a complete bed food was below average the heathrow ba business lounge was a cramped tasteless dirty lounge  it took us  min to find two chairs to seat food was  awful and service is even worst when we wanted to change our departure date by a few days we had to pay a penalty of  plus fee change so we ended up paying  per person in addition to the fare already paid

 trip verified   london to dublin it was never my choice to fly with british airways and i will never fly with them again i was supposed to fly with american airlines from the usa to dublin but i had a connecting flight from my origin city to chicago unfortunately my first flight was delayed due to weather which caused me to miss the flight from chicago to dublin i was put on a flight to london instead which i had to run for when i finally made it to chicago and my bag did not make it on the flight i then flew with british airways from london to dublin i was told to file a lost baggage claim with ba which i did i was told that the bag would be transferred from american to ba when it arrived in dublin using americans baggage tracking system i was able to confirm that the bag arrived the day after i did around noon on saturday i am writing this review on the following sunday and the bag is still not in my possession bas customer service is terrible if someone there tells me one more time to just wait and be patient i am going to lose it my bag has been sitting at the airport in the same city im in for more than a day and i cant get it talk about serious frustration i dont know which airline is at fault for the delay but the difference is that when i called american the rep did everything she could to find out the status of my bag and even though their baggage claim desk was closed when i called she still tried to call an internal number to see if anyone was still around unfortunately she couldnt get hold of anyone but she left them a message and told me exactly who i could call and when to call them the next morning i did not receive that level of service from ba i even asked if they could call the airport and was told we are not authorized to call airports why in the world wouldnt they be authorized to call their own baggage department i am not thrilled with either airline but at least american has made some attempt to help me this has ruined the first three days of a trip that i planned for two years if you do check a bag and its lost or delayed dont expect any help if you flew with ba and heres a tip if you are dealing with a lost or delayed bag in a country you dont live in dont call the generic customer service number on the website you would normally use dig around and see if you can find a number for the airport you flew into you will get a lot more information and assistance that way 
 trip verified   hong kong to london an email on the th august advising us that this flight was cancelled and the hours spent on hold never speaking to anyone what a total awful nightmare then the email at pm saying i must be delighted to find out my flight has not been cancelled all slots in the elemis salon were already booked so no massages were available in first class arriving at hk airport on the return journey and struggling even to get from the pavement to the inside of the terminal why did they not tell us to print out proof of travel we had to wait ages for ba to open a check in desk pretty average food and service in the qantas lounge a broken screen in seat a it would not stay in position and without wedging unusable to constant interruptions during the flight to my partner from a large passenger climbing over him a ghastly sweet and sour chicken main course which made me send my tray away and not eat until after leaving the flight cheapest goodies bag with the broken zip and my suitcase was the very last off the plane i had already been to the ba desk and reported it when it then eventually turned up on the conveyor belt first class out to hk was a good business class experience the return flight in business class was in a word poor the plane was tired ife faulty poor food and the journey was only saved by the quality of the staff they were lovely  but if you give them rubbish tools they will serve rubbish the night term pantry offering was a total joke i have been a ba exec card holder since for ever and i have seen is a decline in the service level certainly not value for money we did not get a club class experience on the flight home

not verified   orlando to gatwick travelling home was extremely disappointing the aircraft was dirty  drink stains on the side of the cabin and the remains of chewing gum on the seatbelt the aircraft aisle was so narrow you had to walk sideways to prevent bumping into other passengers the aircraft had a broken toilet and lights that could not be turned off so for a night flight part of the cabin was illuminated which made sleep difficult the breakfast was a garlic cream cheese croissant which tasted revolting and a highly processed cereal bar only one drinks run was made the standards on ba have plummeted since we last flew them seven years ago such a shame i hope management are looking at reviews such as this to improve service
 trip verified   london to abu dhabi this is the daytime flight from london a very good flight the food was excellent for economy particularly in view of etihads disastrous changes in food service the childrens meals were excellent the entertainment system was great with a good selection it makes a big difference having the entertainment system on when you board and not turn it off until the plane has reached the gate especially when flying with children etihad why dont you do this the cabin crew were good economy in the  is cramped but probably no worse than many good value flight especially as the only other carrier to abu dhabi is etihad
 trip verified   london to st petersburgh huge disappointment for ba business class service in european routes seat pitch has been reduced to  over the last years from  at the expense of passenger comfort seat width is the same as economy with empty middle seat food for me was halfempty plates representing a deli experience and leaving me hungry out of the three options offered two were already out of stock so stranded with the least favourable and most unhealthy food option avoid club europe not worth the money
